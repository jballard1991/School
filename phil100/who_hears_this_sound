	<p><em>During our weekly meetings in the </em>Sun <em>office, editor Sy Safransky and I occasionally stray into philosophical territory. One day, knowing that I&rsquo;d once studied meditation at a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, Sy handed me a couple of videos of talks by the spiritual teacher Adyashanti. At the time, my ardor for the spiritual life was at a low point. My reading of spiritual texts was infrequent, eclectic, and disorganized, and I&rsquo;d stopped meditating regularly. But late one night, unable to sleep, I watched the videos and was drawn to the simplicity and clarity of this man&rsquo;s teachings and his playful yet no-nonsense manner.</em></p>
<p><em>Adyashanti was born in 1962 in Cupertino, California, a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area, and his given name is Stephen Gray. As a teenager he had a passion for racing bicycles and worked in a bike-repair shop. At the age of nineteen, he came across the idea of enlightenment in a book, and it ignited a desire to experience that ineffable state. He built a hut in his parents&rsquo; backyard and practiced meditation there with all the vigor of a competitive athlete, training under the guidance of Zen teacher Arvis Joen Justi. When he was twenty-five, he experienced an awakening, which he describes as &ldquo;a realization of the underlying connectedness and oneness of all beings.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>For the next eight years he continued to meditate &mdash; though he says that all sense of effort and anxiety vanished &mdash; and work in his father&rsquo;s machine shop. In 1996 Justi encouraged Gray to start teaching on his own. He gave his first talks in his aunt&rsquo;s spare room above a garage to just a handful of students. Sometimes no one would show up. Over a few years the small gatherings grew, until there were hundreds of students in attendance each week. During this time Gray took the name &ldquo;Adyashanti,&rdquo; Sanskrit for &ldquo;primordial peace.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>These days Adyashanti gives talks and weekend &ldquo;intensives.&rdquo; He also leads five-night silent retreats, which have become so popular that registration now takes place by random lottery. His teachings seem rooted in the loose, folksy style of the early Chinese Zen masters, as well as in the &ldquo;nondualistic&rdquo; tradition, whose basic tenet is that a separate self, distinct from the rest of the world, is an illusion. The nonprofit organization Open Gate Sangha supports his work and sells his books and recordings of his talks (<a href="http://www.adyashanti.org">www.adyashanti.org</a>). When he&rsquo;s not traveling around the country teaching, Adyashanti lives with his wife in the Bay Area, not far from his childhood home.</em></p>
<p><em>When Sy and I heard that Adyashanti was coming to Asheville, North Carolina, we arranged to meet with him for an interview. On the drive there, as the terrain changed from the rolling hills of North Carolina&rsquo;s Piedmont region to the steeper slopes of the Appalachian Mountains, Sy and I wondered aloud if Adyashanti would say anything we hadn&rsquo;t heard before. As we neared the house where Adyashanti was staying, the trip began to resemble a spiritual pilgrimage: we climbed a narrow road that snaked up the side of a mountain, then descended a treacherous, unpaved path, muddy after a recent rain. When we finally arrived, Adyashanti greeted us in a casual shirt, jeans, and sandals, asking us to call him &ldquo;Adya.&rdquo; At the outset of the interview, he frequently shifted in his seat and laughed a little uncomfortably. Eventually he relaxed and reclined on the couch, a glimmer in his piercing, crystal blue eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>During a pause to change tapes in the recorder, Sy asked Adyashanti about his years as a competitive touring cyclist. &ldquo;I have a blue-collar body,&rdquo; Adyashanti said. &ldquo;It likes to be worked. When I&rsquo;m at home, I&rsquo;ll ride my bike two, three, four times a week. I&rsquo;ll lift weights.&rdquo; He certainly appeared fit, with veins bulging from his forearms. His demeanor seemed blue-collar as well, with his no-frills attitude and his down-to-earth language, nearly free of spiritual jargon. He said of himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a truth guy, not a comfort guy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>After the interview, Sy and I went to a talk Adyashanti gave at a nearby church. Adyashanti&rsquo;s talks are unscripted and draw largely from examples in his own life. But on that evening, what struck me most, beyond his words, was his presence between the words. Sometimes he&rsquo;d pause for a few seconds and close his eyes. His face would become tranquil, and the room would swell with silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Following the talk, Adyashanti answered questions from the audience. A woman sitting near us, whose hands had fidgeted in her lap through most of the evening, took the microphone and said she was feeling a tremendous sadness because she feared that she&rsquo;d never have an awakening experience. Adyashanti asked what her deepest spiritual yearning was. The woman answered, &ldquo;I want to know God.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Adyashanti asked the woman, whose name was Nancy, momentarily to stop her search for God and go in search of Nancy instead. &ldquo;Where is Nancy?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What is Nancy? If I ask you where is your hand, where is your foot, you can answer. But if I ask where is Nancy, where is she? She pretends to be the center of this whole life, but where is she? Is this Nancy anything more than a thought?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</em></p>
<p><em>Adyashanti described the tendency of the human mind to believe in a limited notion of &ldquo;me,&rdquo; a separate self at the core of our being. But when we go in search of that &ldquo;me,&rdquo; we discover something deeper and more vast. &ldquo;What is looking through your eyes right now?&rdquo; he asked the woman.</em></p>
<p><em>After a pause she answered, &ldquo;It feels like life.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go with that. It&rsquo;s life peering through your eyes. So what is life? Is life male or female? When is life&rsquo;s birthday? Does it have an age?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she responded.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;So, at the very center of this thing called &lsquo;you&rsquo; is nothing but life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Nancy; it&rsquo;s life that&rsquo;s peering through. Now, just for fun, let&rsquo;s remove the word life. I like the word life. It&rsquo;s very unspiritual. But since you&rsquo;re in search of God, what if we replace the word life with God? Isn&rsquo;t God life, the essence of all existence?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the woman answered.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;God is peering through right now,&rdquo; said Adyashanti. &ldquo;In this moment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>The woman seemed profoundly moved. &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; she said, her eyes widening.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Hang with that for a while,&rdquo; Adyashanti told her as she quietly took her seat and the next questioner approached the microphone. I noticed that Nancy&rsquo;s hands had stopped fidgeting and were folded together peacefully in her lap.</em></p>
<p align="right"><em>&mdash; Luc Saunders</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Safransky: </strong>Let&rsquo;s pretend that I&rsquo;m thoroughly unfamiliar with contemporary spiritual vocabularies. How would you describe your teaching to me?</p>
<p><strong>Adyashanti: </strong>My background is primarily Zen Buddhism, and yet I would not describe what I teach as Zen. I don&rsquo;t really see myself as transmitting any particular tradition. My teaching has to do with enlightenment, with awakening to what you really are. It does not matter to me anymore whether I use Buddhist vocabulary, or Christian vocabulary, or Hindu vocabulary. Any vocabulary will do.</p>
<p>The heart of my teaching is to help people question their argument with reality, with what is, and also to help them question their whole notion of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Saunders: </strong>Do you use the terms &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; and &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; interchangeably, or are you talking about two different experiences?</p>
<p><strong>Adyashanti: </strong>Awakening is when you realize that what you thought you were was nothing more than a dream, and you perceive the reality outside the dream, what&rsquo;s dreaming the dream of you. It&rsquo;s not just a mystical experience. It is actually realizing the underlying unity of all things.</p>
<p>Simply because you&rsquo;ve had an awakening, however, does not mean you stay awake. Enlightenment, in simple terms, is when you stay awake. If the awakening is abiding, that&rsquo;s enlightenment. And most awakenings are not abiding &mdash; at least, not initially.</p>
<p><strong>Saunders: </strong>Awakening and enlightenment sound like head-bound or heart-bound concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Adyashanti:</strong> Enlightenment has nothing to do with the head or the heart. Certainly, the head and the heart tend to open up, but that&rsquo;s a byproduct. Enlightenment is actually waking up from the head <em>and </em>from the heart. It&rsquo;s waking up from the dream of &ldquo;me&rdquo; and seeing the oneness of all things. That&rsquo;s what I mean by &ldquo;reality&rdquo;: that oneness. The truth is that you are that unity. You are not simply a particular person in a particular body with a particular personality; you are that one reality, which manifests itself as all these seemingly separate things.</p>
<p><strong>Saunders: </strong>Are the body and physical sensations illusory?</p>
<p><strong>Adyashanti: </strong>Yes and no. Ultimately, everything&rsquo;s a dream, and yet you still have to deal with the body. It&rsquo;s still there. You can call it &ldquo;a dream,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s still going to hurt if you bump your head.</p>
<p><strong>Safransky: </strong>Most traditions suggest that years of spiritual practice are necessary before one becomes enlightened, but you say that it&rsquo;s a mistake to look to the future, to see spiritual awakening as some kind of goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adyashanti:</strong> One of the best ways to avoid awakening is to let the idea of awakening be co-opted by the mind and then projected onto a future event: something that&rsquo;s going to happen outside of this moment. Of course, something <em>may </em>happen in the next moment &mdash; something&rsquo;s always happening in the next moment &mdash; but the truth lies right here and right now; it <em>is </em>right here and right now. This looking to the future isn&rsquo;t really the fault of the spiritual practices themselves; it&rsquo;s the attitude with which the mind engages in the practices &mdash; an attitude that is seeking a future end and seeing that end as somehow inherently different from what already exists here and now.</p>
<p>The role of the spiritual practice is basically to exhaust the seeker. If the practice does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, it exhausts our energy for seeking, and then reality has a chance to present itself. In that sense, spiritual practices can help lead to awakening. But that&rsquo;s different from saying that the practice <em>produces </em>the awakening.</p>
<p>The spiritual practitioner is like someone who&rsquo;s running and is really tired and wants to rest. You could say, &ldquo;Well, just stop, then.&rdquo; But they have this idea that they have to cross a finish line before they can stop. If you can convince them that they can just stop, they&rsquo;ll be amazed. They&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I could stop and rest.&rdquo; Or maybe they won&rsquo;t hear what you&rsquo;re telling them, and they&rsquo;ll have to go all the way to their finish line. And after they cross it, then they&rsquo;ll stop and say, &ldquo;Wow! It feels really good to rest.&rdquo; So awakening can come after you cross the finish line in the future, but it&rsquo;s also possible to find it at any point along the way if you stop for just a moment.</p>
<p>As I see it, reality is always looking for that moment of vulnerability, when we let our guard down. It&rsquo;s not looking for good people or bad people. Clearly some real scoundrels have had amazing experiences of reality, right? Some are transformed by them, and some aren&rsquo;t. Reality is not operating on any moral principle. It&rsquo;s looking for a moment when the seeker is exhausted. It can be prompted by some tragic event: an illness, or the death of a loved one, or a divorce. Reality rushes into the crack and presents itself.</p>
<p><strong>Safransky: </strong>Many people say they feel most alive right after having experienced some great loss. Their world stops.</p>
<p><strong>Adyashanti: </strong>Exactly. Everything is stopped. Now, whether they stay stopped is another matter. Just because somebody has a difficult experience and feels much more alive as a result, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t go back to their neurotic ways later. After that initial awakening, there is almost always the work of cleaning up, of the &ldquo;me&rdquo; surrendering itself. I usually say that&rsquo;s the beginning of the second phase of spirituality: what I think of as &ldquo;life after awakening.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s this myth of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I have that experience; I hoist my enlightenment flag, and it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Sooner or later most everybody realizes it&rsquo;s not that simple. There&rsquo;s a whole other phase of the spiritual life that happens after awakening, and in some ways it&rsquo;s more subtle and complex and difficult to navigate. There&rsquo;s not much written about it, and most of what is written is so old and trapped in tradition that modern people can&rsquo;t make sense of it.</p>
