          <p align="center"><b>How public education cripples our kids, and why</b></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b>I</b></font>
          taught for thirty years in some of the worst schools in Manhattan, and 
		  in some of the best, and during that time I became an expert in 
		  boredom. Boredom was everywhere in my world, and if you asked the 
		  kids, as I often did, <i>why</i> they felt so bored, they always gave 
		  the same answers: They said the work was stupid, that it made no 
		  sense, that they already knew it. They said they wanted to be doing 
		  something real, not just sitting around. They said teachers didn&#39;t 
		  seem to know much about their subjects and clearly weren&#39;t interested 
		  in learning more. And the kids were right: their teachers were every 
		  bit as bored as they were.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Boredom is the common 
		  condition of schoolteachers, and anyone who has spent time in a 
		  teachers&#39; lounge can vouch for the low energy, the whining, the 
		  dispirited attitudes, to be found there. When asked why <i>they</i>
          feel bored, the teachers tend to blame the kids, as you might expect. 
		  Who wouldn&#39;t get bored teaching students who are rude and interested 
		  only in grades? If even that. Of course, teachers are themselves 
		  products of the same twelve-year compulsory school programs that so 
		  thoroughly bore their students, and as school personnel they are 
		  trapped inside structures even more rigid than those imposed upon the 
		  children. Who, then, is to blame?</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We all are. My 
		  grandfather taught me that. One afternoon when I was seven I 
		  complained to him of boredom, and he batted me hard on the head. He 
		  told me that I was never to use that term in his presence again, that 
		  if I was bored it was my fault and no one else&#39;s. The obligation to 
		  amuse and instruct myself was entirely my own, and people who didn&#39;t 
		  know that were childish people, to be avoided if possible. Certainly 
		  not to be trusted. That episode cured me of boredom forever, and here 
		  and there over the years I was able to pass on the lesson to some 
		  remarkable student. For the most part, however, I found it futile to 
		  challenge the official notion that boredom and childishness were the 
		  natural state of affairs in the classroom. Often I had to defy custom, 
		  and even bend the law, to help kids break out of this trap.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The empire struck back, 
		  of course; childish adults regularly conflate opposition with 
		  disloyalty. I once returned from a medical leave to discover that all 
		  evidence of my having been granted the leave had been purposely 
		  destroyed, that my job had been terminated, and that I no longer 
		  possessed even a teaching license. After nine months of tormented 
		  effort I was able to retrieve the license when a school secretary 
		  testified to witnessing the plot unfold. In the meantime my family 
		  suffered more than I care to remember. By the time I finally retired 
		  in 1991, I had more than enough reason to think of our schools - with 
		  their long-term, cell-block-style, forced confinement of both students 
		  and teachers - as virtual factories of childishness. Yet I honestly 
		  could not see why they had to be that way. My own experience had 
		  revealed to me what many other teachers must learn along the way, too, 
		  yet keep to themselves for fear of reprisal: if we wanted to we could 
		  easily and inexpensively jettison the old, stupid structures and help 
		  kids take an education rather than merely receive a schooling. We 
		  could encourage the best qualities of youthfulness - curiosity, 
		  adventure, resilience, the capacity for surprising insight - simply by 
		  being more flexible about time, texts, and tests, by introducing kids 
		  to truly competent adults, and by giving each student what autonomy he 
		  or she needs in order to take a risk every now and then.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">But we don&#39;t do that. And 
		  the more I asked why not, and persisted in thinking about the 
		  &quot;problem&quot; of schooling as an engineer might, the more I missed the 
		  point: What if there is no &quot;problem&quot; with our schools? What if they 
		  are the way they are, so expensively flying in the face of common 
		  sense and long experience in how children learn things, not because 
		  they are doing something wrong but because they are doing something 
		  right? Is it possible that George W. Bush accidentally spoke the truth 
		  when he said we would &quot;leave no child behind&quot;? Could it be that our 
		  schools are designed to make sure not one of them ever really grows 
		  up?</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="5">D</font></b>o 
		  we really need school? I don&#39;t mean education, just forced schooling: 
		  six classes a day, five days a week, nine months a year, for twelve 
		  years. Is this deadly routine really necessary? And if so, for what? 
		  Don&#39;t hide behind reading, writing, and arithmetic as a rationale, 
		  because 2 million happy homeschoolers have surely put that banal 
		  justification to rest. Even if they hadn&#39;t, a considerable number of 
		  well-known Americans never went through the twelve-year wringer our 
		  kids currently go through, and they turned out all right. George 
		  Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln? 
		  Someone taught them, to be sure, but they were not products of a 
		  school system, and not one of them was ever &quot;graduated&quot; from a 
		  secondary school. Throughout most of American history, kids generally 
		  didn&#39;t go to high school, yet the unschooled rose to be admirals, like 
		  Farragut; inventors, like Edison; captains of industry, like Carnegie 
		  and Rockefeller; writers, like Melville and Twain and Conrad; and even 
		  scholars, like Margaret Mead. In fact, until pretty recently people 
		  who reached the age of thirteen weren&#39;t looked upon as children at 
		  all. Ariel Durant, who co-wrote an enormous, and very good, 
		  multivolume history of the world with her husband, Will, was happily 
		  married at fifteen, and who could reasonably claim that Ariel Durant 
		  was an uneducated person? Unschooled, perhaps, but not uneducated.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We have been taught (that 
		  is, schooled) in this country to think of &quot;success&quot; as synonymous 
		  with, or at least dependent upon, &quot;schooling,&quot; but historically that 
		  isn&#39;t true in either an intellectual or a financial sense. And plenty 
		  of people throughout the world today find a way to educate themselves 
		  without resorting to a system of compulsory secondary schools that all 
		  too often resemble prisons. Why, then, do Americans confuse education 
		  with just such a system? What exactly is the purpose of our public 
		  schools?</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Mass schooling of a 
		  compulsory nature really got its teeth into the United States between 
		  1905 and 1915, though it was conceived of much earlier and pushed for 
		  throughout most of the nineteenth century. The reason given for this 
		  enormous upheaval of family life and cultural traditions was, roughly 
		  speaking, threefold:&nbsp;<br>
          1) To make good people.&nbsp;<br>
          2) To make good citizens.&nbsp;<br>
          3) To make each person his or her personal best.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">These goals are still 
		  trotted out today on a regular basis, and most of us accept them in 
		  one form or another as a decent definition of public education&#39;s 
		  mission, however short schools actually fall in achieving them. But we 
		  are dead wrong. Compounding our error is the fact that the national 
		  literature holds numerous and surprisingly consistent statements of 
		  compulsory schooling&#39;s true purpose. We have, for example, the great 
		  H. L. Mencken, who wrote in <i>The American Mercury</i> for April 1924 
		  that the aim of public education is not&nbsp;</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">to fill the young of 
			the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence. . . . 
			Nothing could be further from the truth. The aim.. . is simply to 
			reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to 
			breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and 
			originality. That is its aim in the United States . . . and that is 
			its aim everywhere else.&nbsp;</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Because of Mencken&#39;s 
		  reputation as a satirist, we might be tempted to dismiss this passage 
		  as a bit of hyperbolic sarcasm. His article, however, goes on to trace 
		  the template for our own educational system back to the now vanished, 
		  though never to be forgotten, military state of Prussia. And although 
		  he was certainly aware of the irony that we had recently been at war 
		  with Germany, the heir to Prussian thought and culture, Mencken was 
		  being perfectly serious here. Our educational system really is 
		  Prussian in origin, and that really is cause for concern.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The odd fact of a 
		  Prussian provenance for our schools pops up again and again once you 
		  know to look for it. William James alluded to it many times at the 
		  turn of the century. Orestes Brownson, the hero of Christopher Lasch&#39;s 
		  1991 book, <i>The True and Only Heaven</i>, was publicly denouncing 
		  the Prussianization of American schools back in the 1840s. Horace 
		  Mann&#39;s &quot;Seventh Annual Report&quot; to the Massachusetts State Board of 
		  Education in 1843 is essentially a paean to the land of Frederick the 
		  Great and a call for its schooling to be brought here. That Prussian 
		  culture loomed large in America is hardly surprising, given our early 
		  association with that utopian state. A Prussian served as Washington&#39;s 
		  aide during the Revolutionary War, and so many German- speaking people 
		  had settled here by 1795 that Congress considered publishing a 
		  German-language edition of the federal laws. But what shocks is that 
		  we should so eagerly have adopted one of the very worst aspects of 
		  Prussian culture: an educational system deliberately designed to 
		  produce mediocre intellects, to hamstring the inner life, to deny 
		  students appreciable leadership skills, and to ensure docile and 
		  incomplete citizens - all in order to render the populace 
		  &quot;manageable.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="5">I</font></b>t 
		  was from James Bryant Conant - president of Harvard for twenty years, 
		  WWI poison-gas specialist, WWII executive on the atomic-bomb project, 
		  high commissioner of the American zone in Germany after WWII, and 
		  truly one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century - 
		  that I first got wind of the real purposes of American schooling. 
		  Without Conant, we would probably not have the same style and degree 
		  of standardized testing that we enjoy today, nor would we be blessed 
		  with gargantuan high schools that warehouse 2,000 to 4,000 students at 
		  a time, like the famous Columbine High in Littleton, Colorado. Shortly 
		  after I retired from teaching I picked up Conant&#39;s 1959 book-length 
		  essay, <i>The Child the Parent and the State</i>, and was more than a 
		  little intrigued to see him mention in passing that the modern schools 
		  we attend were the result of a &quot;revolution&quot; engineered between 1905 
		  and 1930. A revolution? He declines to elaborate, but he does direct 
		  the curious and the uninformed to Alexander Inglis&#39;s 1918 book, <i>
		  Principles of Secondary Education</i>, in which &quot;one saw this 
		  revolution through the eyes of a revolutionary.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Inglis, for whom a 
		  lecture in education at Harvard is named, makes it perfectly clear 
		  that compulsory schooling on this continent was intended to be just 
		  what it had been for Prussia in the 1820s: a fifth column into the 
		  burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants 
		  and the proletarians a voice at the bargaining table. Modern, 
		  industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical 
		  incision into the prospective unity of these underclasses. Divide 
		  children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, 
		  and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the 
		  ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever 
		  reintegrate into a dangerous whole.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Inglis breaks down the 
		  purpose - the actual purpose - of modem schooling into six basic 
		  functions, any one of which is enough to curl the hair of those 
		  innocent enough to believe the three traditional goals listed earlier:</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">1) The <i>adjustive</i>
          or <i>adaptive</i> function. Schools are to establish fixed habits of 
		  reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment 
		  completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or 
		  interesting material should be taught, because you can&#39;t test for 
		  reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, 
		  and do, foolish and boring things.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">2) The <i>integrating</i>
          function. This might well be called &quot;the conformity function,&quot; because 
		  its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who 
		  conform are predictable, and this is of great use to those who wish to 
		  harness and manipulate a large labor force.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">3) The <i>diagnostic and 
		  directive</i> function. School is meant to determine each student&#39;s 
		  proper social role. This is done by logging evidence mathematically 
		  and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in &quot;your permanent record.&quot; 
		  Yes, you do have one.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">4) The <i>differentiating</i>
          function. Once their social role has been &quot;diagnosed,&quot; children are to 
		  be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the 
		  social machine merits - and not one step further. So much for making 
		  kids their personal best.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">5) The <i>selective</i>
          function. This refers not to human choice at all but to Darwin&#39;s 
		  theory of natural selection as applied to what he called &quot;the favored 
		  races.&quot; In short, the idea is to help things along by consciously 
		  attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the 
		  unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and other punishments - 
		  clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and 
		  effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes. That&#39;s what 
		  all those little humiliations from first grade onward were intended to 
		  do: wash the dirt down the drain.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">6) The <i>propaedeutic</i>
          function. The societal system implied by these rules will require an 
		  elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids 
		  will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to 
		  watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and 
		  declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and 
		  corporations might never want for obedient labor.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">That, unfortunately, is 
		  the purpose of mandatory public education in this country. And lest 
		  you take Inglis for an isolated crank with a rather too cynical take 
		  on the educational enterprise, you should know that he was hardly 
		  alone in championing these ideas. Conant himself, building on the 
		  ideas of Horace Mann and others, campaigned tirelessly for an American 
		  school system designed along the same lines. Men like George Peabody, 
		  who funded the cause of mandatory schooling throughout the South, 
		  surely understood that the Prussian system was useful in creating not 
		  only a harmless electorate and a servile labor force but also a 
		  virtual herd of mindless consumers. In time a great number of 
		  industrial titans came to recognize the enormous profits to be had by 
		  cultivating and tending just such a herd via public education, among 
		  them Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller.</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="5">T</font></b>here 
		  you have it. Now you know. We don&#39;t need Karl Marx&#39;s conception of a 
		  grand warfare between the classes to see that it is in the interest of 
		  complex management, economic or political, to dumb people down, to 
		  demoralize them, to divide them from one another, and to discard them 
		  if they don&#39;t conform. Class may frame the proposition, as when 
		  Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton University, said the 
		  following to the New York City School Teachers Association in 1909: 
		  &quot;We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want 
		  another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in 
		  every society, to forgo the privileges of a liberal education and fit 
		  themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.&quot; But the 
		  motives behind the disgusting decisions that bring about these ends 
		  need not be class-based at all. They can stem purely from fear, or 
		  from the by now familiar belief that &quot;efficiency&quot; is the paramount 
		  virtue, rather than love, liberty, laughter, or hope. Above all, they 
		  can stem from simple greed.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">There were vast fortunes 
		  to be made, after all, in an economy based on mass production and 
		  organized to favor the large corporation rather than the small 
		  business or the family farm. But mass production required mass 
		  consumption, and at the turn of the twentieth century most Americans 
		  considered it both unnatural and unwise to buy things they didn&#39;t 
		  actually need. Mandatory schooling was a godsend on that count. School 
		  didn&#39;t have to train kids in any direct sense to think they should 
		  consume nonstop, because it did something even better: it encouraged 
		  them not to think at all. And that left them sitting ducks for another 
		  great invention of the modem era - marketing.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, you needn&#39;t have 
		  studied marketing to know that there are two groups of people who can 
		  always be convinced to consume more than they need to: addicts and 
		  children. School has done a pretty good job of turning our children 
		  into addicts, but it has done a spectacular job of turning our 
		  children into children. Again, this is no accident. Theorists from 
		  Plato to Rousseau to our own Dr. Inglis knew that if children could be 
		  cloistered with other children, stripped of responsibility and 
		  independence, encouraged to develop only the trivializing emotions of 
		  greed, envy, jealousy, and fear, they would grow older but never truly 
		  grow up. In the 1934 edition of his once well-known book <i>Public 
		  Education in the United States</i>, Ellwood P. Cubberley detailed and 
		  praised the way the strategy of successive school enlargements had 
		  extended childhood by two to six years, and forced schooling was at 
		  that point still quite new. This same Cubberley - who was dean of 
		  Stanford&#39;s School of Education, a textbook editor at Houghton Mifflin, 
		  and Conant&#39;s friend and correspondent at Harvard - had written the 
		  following in the 1922 edition of his book <i>Public School 
		  Administration</i>: &quot;Our schools are . . . factories in which the raw 
		  products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned.. . . And it is the 
		  business of the school to build its pupils according to the 
		  specifications laid down.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It&#39;s perfectly obvious 
		  from our society today what those specifications were. Maturity has by 
		  now been banished from nearly every aspect of our lives. Easy divorce 
		  laws have removed the need to work at relationships; easy credit has 
		  removed the need for fiscal self-control; easy entertainment has 
		  removed the need to learn to entertain oneself; easy answers have 
		  removed the need to ask questions. We have become a nation of 
		  children, happy to surrender our judgments and our wills to political 
		  exhortations and commercial blandishments that would insult actual 
		  adults. We buy televisions, and then we buy the things we see on the 
		  television. We buy computers, and then we buy the things we see on the 
		  computer. We buy $150 sneakers whether we need them or not, and when 
		  they fall apart too soon we buy another pair. We drive SUVs and 
		  believe the lie that they constitute a kind of life insurance, even 
		  when we&#39;re upside-down in them. And, worst of all, we don&#39;t bat an eye 
		  when Ari Fleischer tells us to &quot;be careful what you say,&quot; even if we 
		  remember having been told somewhere back in school that America is the 
		  land of the free. We simply buy that one too. Our schooling, as 
		  intended, has seen to it.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="5"><b>N</b></font>ow 
		  for the good news. Once you understand the logic behind modern 
		  schooling, its tricks and traps are fairly easy to avoid. School 
		  trains children to be employees and consumers; teach your own to be 
		  leaders and adventurers. School trains children to obey reflexively; 
		  teach your own to think critically and independently. Well-schooled 
		  kids have a low threshold for boredom; help your own to develop an 
		  inner life so that they&#39;ll never be bored. Urge them to take on the 
		  serious material, the <i>grown-up</i> material, in history, 
		  literature, philosophy, music, art, economics, theology - all the 
		  stuff schoolteachers know well enough to avoid. Challenge your kids 
		  with plenty of solitude so that they can learn to enjoy their own 
		  company, to conduct inner dialogues. Well-schooled people are 
		  conditioned to dread being alone, and they seek constant companionship 
		  through the TV, the computer, the cell phone, and through shallow 
		  friendships quickly acquired and quickly abandoned. Your children 
		  should have a more meaningful life, and they can.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">First, though, we must 
		  wake up to what our schools really are: laboratories of 
		  experimentation on young minds, drill centers for the habits and 
		  attitudes that corporate society demands. Mandatory education serves 
		  children only incidentally; its real purpose is to turn them into 
		  servants. Don&#39;t let your own have their childhoods extended, not even 
		  for a day. If David Farragut could take command of a captured British 
		  warship as a preteen, if Thomas Edison could publish a broadsheet at 
		  the age of twelve, if Ben Franklin could apprentice himself to a 
		  printer at the same age (then put himself through a course of study 
		  that would choke a Yale senior today), there&#39;s no telling what your 
		  own kids could do. After a long life, and thirty years in the public 
		  school trenches, I&#39;ve concluded that genius is as common as dirt. We 
		  suppress our genius only because we haven&#39;t yet figured out how to 
		  manage a population of educated men and women. The solution, I think, 
		  is simple and glorious. Let them manage themselves.</font></td>
