1) Create the class member function definitions in main.cpp, for class TV. Complete the components and compile and run the program with the client code provided in main.cpp.

2) Change the class public member functions, to private member functions, and try to compile and run your program. Do you see any errors?

3) Add the appropriate mutators and accessors for the private member variables, and change the client code to call these member functions to set/get the values, and recompile and run your code.

4) When and why do you think it is a good idea to use private member variables vs. public member variables.

5) Upload your completed function to assignment #6.
