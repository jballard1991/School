     Canopic Jars Presentation         \/_/       John Ballard -- JohnBallard91@gmail.com   


 
Canopic Jars are used for storing some organs of Mummified ancient people. Many are adorned with animal heads and writing, they were a crucial part of the ancient Egyptian funeral rite. They held religious significance in addition to their practical function of preserving the organs.

FOUR SEPERATE JARS FOR FOUR SONS OF HOURUS -> Each has a separate GODDESS to protect a separate organ
Stomach -> Jackal Head (Duamutef) -> Goddess Neith
Liver -> Imseti, human head -> Goddess Isis
Lungs -> Baboon Head (Hapi) -> Goddess Nephthys
Intestines -> FALCON HEAD (Qebehsenuef) -> Goddess Serqet

Serqet -> Scorpion Goddess daughter of Neith. Dealt in realms of fertility, nature, animals, medicine, magic, and healing venom. 
Note:	* Scorpion strings in Egypt and North African can be fatal.


NATRONS -> Egyptian curing salts 
	+--> Sodium Carbonate , Sodium Bi-Carbonate , Sodium 			Chloride
	+--->	"Baking soda + salts", Found easily along    			certain rivers in egypt
	+---->	~About 400 lbs needed to embalm body, expensive 
	

After removal from the body, organs were treated with perfumes oils, spices, and then wrapped in cloth

CANOPIC CHEST -> All 4 Jars could be placed together inside of a chest inside of the tomb, these were important items to protect

Not all jars are properly made due to financial concerns, some have all human heads. 

Animals heads begin to appear after the old and middle kingdom, around the time of king Tutankhamun, ~1300 BC

Only 2 known tombs contain wall paintings showing the process of mummification, If anything was written down on papyrus it is lost or has not survived.


Note: Reisin poured into the nose to seal the head cavity after brain removed.

Anubis is the god of death -> Head of a Jackal -> Jackals have problems digesting meat and lack the enzymes to do so, they prefer meat that has begun to rot -> Association with death

Cutting tools were obsidian, a sliver of flaked obsidian can be far sharper than steel scalpels used today.
