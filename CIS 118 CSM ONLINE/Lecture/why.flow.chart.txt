Why do Flow Charting ? Read me..

Hello Class

In programming, your 'GOAL' is to produce programs that work.

To accomplish that goal, there are methods and tools that 'increase' the likelihood that you will write programs that work.

Flow charting is a method which:

FORCES YOU TO STOP AND SMELL THE ROSES. In other words, to seriously look at the logic and flow of your program.

Why look at the program in detail ? It is to increase your  success rate in writing programs that work.

As a programmer, you will do what it takes to insure that you produce a quality 'working' product. Flow charting is a method to 'achieve' that goal.

When you work in private Industry, you will find that over HALF of software projects FAIL... Yes, you read that right... HALF.

Why, do they fail... there are many reasons.

1) Lack of money

2) Competition

3) Lack of skill by workers.. Who do not doing EVERYTHING they can to insure that the product they produce is:

CORRECT and COMPLETE.

The choice is yours. 

Increase the likelihood of success and use flowcharting.

or Decrease the likelihood of success and choose not to use flowcharting.

 

Simply put, you DO flowcharting or some type of charting to INCREASE the likelihood of success.

Most Sincerely,

Professor Schwarz
