      The dialogue presents two opposing pedagogical approaches to the education 
      of political leadership: first, the approach of a Socratic-like lover of 
      wisdom, who seeks to "free" citizens through philosophical play for lives 
      of excellence (<I>arete</I>) and for the application of their leadership 
      skills to the construction of a just society for the public good; and 
      second, the approach of tyrannical sophists who educate and rule in the 
      city by coercive force for private advantage and the enslavement of 
      citizens for a ruler's own personal ends. Plato's <I>Republic</I> aims to 
      show that philosophical "play" is the best pedagogical means to educate a 
      just citizenry and to prepare philosophical leaders to govern.</p>

      <P>This paper traces a central connection between play (<I>paidia</I>) and 
      education (<I>paideia</I>) in Plato's 
      <I>Republic</I>. <small><small>(1)</small></small> In this 
	  dialogue play is presented as the best 
      pedagogical means in the education of a just citizenry and the cultivation 
      of philosophical leaders who can apply their knowledge and experience to 
      establishing a just city (<I>polis</I>). My hermeneutical approach to the 
      <I>Republic</I> is shaped by more recent approaches to Plato's dialogues that 
      consider the dialogue form as significant for an understanding of the 
      content of the dialogues. Specific to the connection between play and 
      education in the <I>Republic</I> is the dramatic context which identifies 
      a life-and-death struggle between philosophy/freedom and sophistry/tyranny 
      in terms of their respective approaches to education/culture and 
      leadership in establishment of a "just" city.</P>
      <P><B>Education/Play in the Context of the Dialogue, the 
      Characters, and the struggle between Philosophy/Free-Play and 
      Sophistry/Tyrannical Control.</B></P>
      <P>The dramatic form of the <I>Republic</I>, the character of the 
      participants, and the social-political context of events in Athens and 
      Greece during the time of Socrates and Plato all have important 
      implications for the interpretation of the philosophical meaning of the 
      dialogue. <small><small>(2)</small></small> They help the reader 
	  to understand its central aim and 
      purpose &#151; the construction of a just city in words (<I>polin...logo, 
      </I>2.369a; <I>lexeos</I>, 5.473a) and the cultivation of who will govern 
      a community justly. <small><small>(3)</small></small> This 
	  aim is supported by the philosophical search for 
      the Good, the protection of the just city from dangers that would threaten 
      to bring about its decline and fall, and the educational means most likely 
      to make the construction of a such a just city possible. 
      Socrates' proposal for an educational process likely to result in the 
      creation of a free and liberating city, is playful in its approach but 
      serious in its intent. Not unexpectedly, this serious topic of education 
      (<I>paideia</I>) is presented with much playfulness (<I>paidia</I>) by the 
      author of the dialogue and in the context of struggle (<I>agon</I>) and 
      contest. This conflict between two approaches to education &#151; learning by 
      force/coercion (<I>bia</I>) versus learning by free-play &#151; is manifest in 
      the conflict between tyrannical force and philosophical persuasion, 
      sophistry and philosophy, and between private advantage and the public 
      good.</P>
      <P>The prominence of play (<I>paidia</I>) in the <I>Republic</I> is 
      reflected in the interplay of the interlocutors, and is particularly 
      prevalent in the thought and life of Socrates and his extended discussion 
      with Thrasymachos, an arch-sophist, and with Plato's two brothers, 
      Adeimantos and Glaucon. Socrates, the principal "player" in the 
	  dialogue, while considering the 
      importance of dialectic in the education of philosophical rulers, 
      describes his discussion with Adeimantos and Glaucon about the education 
      of philosophical leaders and the consititution of the "city in 
      words" as "playing" (<I>paidzomen</I>, 7.536b-c).</P>
      <P>Readers of the dialogue are warned that the spoken and written report 
      of the proceedings is not a first hand account, but a "replay" &#151; a retelling 
	  from memory &#151; by Socrates, who "yesterday" stayed up all night talking with others in 
      Piraeus about the desirability of a just life and a just society. It takes 
      about 10 hours to read the dialogue aloud so it is likely that the actual 
      conversation lasted at least that long. However, even if readers grant to 
      Socrates a prodigious memory for the details of an all-night conversation 
      in Piraeus, and an accurate retelling of the night's discussion to 
      an anonymous hearer on the following day, it is unlikely that readers can 
      be confident that they have an authoritative and unbiased presentation of 
      the views of any of the main characters including Socrates or even of 
      Plato, their inventive author, who was not listed as present. Rather, the 
      speeches of the participants must be read cautiously in a way which 
      requires that readers and interpreters not assume that Socrates re-telling 
      of the lengthy discussion, and Plato's written 
      account, are entirely unbiased and accurate or can be accepted 
      uncritically. Readers must work through the issues and the problems of 
      interpretation for themselves.</P>
      <P>Socrates opens the <I>Republic</I> the account of his journey outside 
      of Athens and says, "I went down (<I>katabaino</I>) to Piraeus yesterday 
      with Glaucon, the son of Ariston, to pray to the goddess; and at the same 
      time, I wanted to observe how they would put on the festival" (1.327a). 
      The dramatic occasion of the dialogue is set at about 416 B.C.E. at the 
      time of the institution of the new festival in honor of the goddess 
      Bendis &#151; goddess of the moon <small><small>(4)</small></small> and 
	  of night &#151; who is being celebrated in the 
      evening festivities at Piraeus with a torchlight 
	  parade. <small><small>(5)</small></small> Much has been 
      made of the spatio-temporal features of this opening passage and other 
      highlights in the dialogue such as the Myth of the 
	  Cave. <small><small>(6)</small></small> Both involve a 
      downward descent &#151; Socrates' trip to the "lower" night-time world 
      of Piraeus harbour and, in the Myth of the Cave, the downward descent of 
      the philosopher's return to the shadowy everyday world inside 
      the darkness of the cave. It is also significant that these "descents" to 
	  nether worlds occur in the dark of night 
      at Piraeus and in the disorienting darkness that permeates everyday life 
      in the cave.</P>
      <P>The Myth of the Cave is presented as a metaphor of education 
      (<I>paideia</I>, 7.514a) but it may also serve as a model of the role of 
      an educational mentor, such as Socrates. Thus, we can compare Socrates to 
      the free, philosophical wise man who reenters the nether-world of the dark 
      cave &#151; the world of everyday affairs in which people live and move and have 
      their being &#151; in order to attempt to rescue those who live in this shadowy 
      world, while facing the danger of having his life threatened by the 
      violent reaction of the "prisoners" inside the cave 
      who find their world disturbed by a Socratic rescuer (7.517a). The 
      playground or arena for the pedagogical contest between philosophical, 
      free inquiry and sophistic demagoguery takes place in the dark world of 
      the cave &#151; a world of shadows, and public opinion, a world of "getting and 
      spending" and social-political intrigue.</P>
      <P>Some interpreters of the dialogue have drawn attention to the struggle 
      that takes place in the dialogue between tyranny and philosophy, between 
      violent force and rational persuasion, <small><small>(7)</small></small> 
	  between education as represented by 
      the sophists who aim at success and mastery over their students, and by 
      Socratic philosophers who seek to nurture their students through a 
      liberating philosophical quest for wisdom. This conflict between injustice 
      and justice, between sophistry and philosophy is mirrored not only in the 
      arguments and debate of the interlocutors, but also in the very lives and 
      characters of the participants themselves. <small><small>(8)</small></small> </P>
      <P>Gathered at Polemarchos' house, where the discussion takes place, are 
      almost a dozen men. What is known of the lives and characters of some of 
      the main participants in the discussion, as well as their disposition 
      toward tyranny or philosophy, is also relevant to the analysis of play and 
      education and the interpretation of the dialogue. I will deal with only a 
      few of the participants whose presence is relevant to the interpretation 
      advanced in this paper. First of all, Socrates, our narrator, who raises 
      the issue of a just life and a just society and education as a means to 
      achieve it, shows himself to be dedicated to a life of excellence, and the 
      cardinal virtues &#151; temperance, courage, wisdom and justice. He represents 
      the philosopher <I>par excellence</I> constantly striving for wisdom and 
      the appropriation of these virtues into his own life. The etymological 
      meaning of the names in Plato's dialogues often reveals significant 
      characteristics of the participants, and the <I>Republic</I> is no 
      exception. The name of "Socrates" is derived from "<I>sodzein</I>" (save) 
      and "<I>kratein</I>" (to have the power) which together means "one who has 
      the power to save or rescue." Presumably Socrates' power to save was 
      directed primarily at others because he could not "save" himself from 
      being found guilty of irreligion and the corruption of youth before the 
      Athenian court. However, he did "save himself" from rendering 
      evil for evil, preferring to suffer evil rather than do it (See the 
      <I>Crito</I>). As an educational mentor Socrates shows himself as a kind 
      of mid-wife of ideas, and a pedagogue who leads potential learners to 
      discover the truth for themselves, by "purging" them of false opinions and encouraging them 
      to pursue the truth with the aid of their philosophical mentor. But 
      Socrates is also a playful trickster and a wizard (<I>goete</I>), a 
      practitioner of irony (1.337a) who little by little may lead us astray. So 
      careful readers must not be content to accept what he says at "face 
      value," but must test it for themselves and go beyond the dialogue in 
      working some of these things out on their own.</P>
      <P>Socrates is accompanied on his journey to Piraeus by Glaucon and they 
      are joined at the site of the discussion by Glaucon's brother, 
      Adeimantos. Both young men have philosophical potential, and both are 
      brothers of Plato, the author of the dialogue, who was not present at the 
      discussion. The three brothers are sons of Ariston &#151; a name which means 
      "the best" &#151; and which leads Socrates jokingly to address Glaucon as 
      "you 
      best of men" (7.536e). Later as Socrates discusses the power of the 
      "rule 
      of the best"/aristocracy, we see that the designation "best" applies primarlily 
      not to those of noble birth, but to those whose character and actions are 
      marked by excellence and achievement. Both Adeimantos and Glaucon 
      distinguished themselves courageously at the battle of 
	  Megara. <small><small>(9)</small></small> &#151; an 
      indication of their courage. Socrates describes the character of these 
      brothers in the words of an admiring poet as "sons (<I>paides</I>) of 
      Ariston, divine (<I>theion</I>) offspring of a famous man" (2.368.a). 
      Glaucon and Adeimantus are cast in the roles of potential philosophers 
      caught in the struggle between tyrannical force and philosophical 
      persuasion, between violent oppression and a just society,and between the 
      poles of philosophical/practical life and the sophistical pursuit of 
      self-interest.</P>
      <P>Socrates personifies the integration of wisdom and justice in his own 
      life and he brings to the fore the issue of justice in the life of the 
      community. Thrasymachos and his fellow sophists &#151; the power-wielding 
      politicians &#151; argue in favour of injustice and self-interest personified in 
      Thrasymachos' definition of tyranny &#151; "which by stealth and force (<I>bia</I>) takes 
      away what belongs to others, both what is sacred and profane, private and 
      public, not bit by bit, but all at once" (1.344a). 
      Although Thrasymachos participates actively in the discussion only in Book 
      1, he represents the position of the sophists as defenders of 
      self-interest and the tyrannical rule of the community by force and so his 
      presence looms large over the entire dialogue. When he first enters into 
      the discussion he has to be restrained by the men sitting near him who 
      want to hear the argument out (1.336b). He breaks into the discussion like 
      a "wild beast" (<I>therion</I>) and "he hurled himself upon us as if he 
      would tear us to pieces" (1.336b). Thrasymachos' entry into the 
      discussion is like the attack of a vicious "wolf" (1.336d) &#151; a very 
      important allusion to the tyrannical character of sophists, who are 
      associated with the violent attacks of wolves, as opposed to the more 
      gentle behaviour of philosophers who are linked with the discriminating 
      watchfulness of well-disciplined dogs! <small><small>(10)</small></small> 
	  Thrasymachos represents the violent 
      intrusion of force into the well-ordered dialogue of the community, so he 
      must be restrained in order not to interrupt the discussion (1.336b). 
      After being subdued he must also be prevented from leaving the house until 
      he has heard Socrates' response to his speech that "he poured like a 
      bathman...in a sudden flood over our ears" (1.344d). Although 
      Thrasymachos, whose name means "clever and overbold in schemes and 
      machinations," is somewhat "tamed" and reduced to silence by Socrates in 
      Book 1, nevertheless, by his presence he continues to represent the 
      powerful and tyrannical tendencies of the sophists in the social-political 
      realm. </P>
      <P>The conflict between Socrates and Thrasymachos is characteristic of the 
      struggle between philosophy and tyranny, gentle persuasion and violent 
      oppression throughout the dialogue. This conflict also has implications 
      for the interpretation of the <I>Republic</I>. It suggests that the 
      speeches must not be read "straight on" as it were, as if we could 
      determine the innermost thoughts of Socrates or Plato on these matters, 
      but always in context of a violent struggle between philosophy and 
      sophistry, between a just society and a tyranny. This conflict between 
      "aristocracy" &#151; the "philosophical" rule of the city by the best &#151; and 
      "tyranny" also has some counter-effects on the ideal 
      city proposed by Socrates for the city takes on some tyrannical 
      characteristcs of its own, banishing poets and story tellers such that 
      Plato and even Socrates would be unwelcome citizens in this ideal city. Of 
      special note in the dialogue is the effect that tyranny has on philosophy, 
      as the "love of wisdom," and on the account of Love/<I>Eros/Philia</I> 
      which is presented. For example, <I>Eros</I>, the desire for the 
      beautiful, is described in dialogues such as the <I>Phaedrus</I> and the 
      <I>Symposium</I> as a divine gift and the creative source of the greatest 
      individual and social benefits in the <I>polis. </I>However, in the 
      <I>Republic Eros</I> is described as a "tyrant" (1.329c, 3.402b-403c) 
	  whose "gifts" must be curbed 
      and censored. It is important to take these tyrannical aspects into 
      account in the interpretation of the text and to be aware of the 
      tentativeness of "the city in words" outlined in the 
      dialogue. <small><small>(11)</small></small> </P>
      <P>In the presentation of the playful dramatic elements of the dialogue 
      there are elements of seriousness (<I>spoude</I>) and play (<I>paidia</I>) 
      combined. Firstly, there is the "seriousness" of the issue of 
      justice applied to the life of the individual and the community. Secondly, 
      there is the playful attempt to describe this in words and the ironic 
      reminder from Socrates that the construction of the city is a form of 
      "play" and a "game" (<I>paidia</I>) &#151; a suggestion that the "image" of the ideal 
      city, which Socrates describes, must not be taken too seriously as though 
      it might be regarded as a blueprint of an ideal community or even that it 
      is realizable. Serious and tragic elements are also manifest in the 
      serious impact on the lives of the key characters, the account of the 
      likelihood of the decline of the just city, and the entry of politics into 
      the life of Socrates resulting in his conviction and death as a dangerous 
      threat to the Athenian <I>polis</I>. <small><small>(12)</small></small> But 
	  as a form of play, the 
      <i>Republic</i> itself is comically optimistic, especially on the question 
      of the actual establishment of this city in words in the face of three 
      giant waves of opposition &#151; the equal education and participation of women 
      as rulers (5.446a-456b), the much more difficult issue of marriage rites, 
      and of wives and children in common (5.456b-473b), and finally, the 
      political rulership of philosophers (5.473b-480a). It is also significant 
      that each of these three "waves" that threaten the ideal city involve a degree 
      of the tyrannical repression and control of <I>Eros/Philia</I>/Love in the 
      life of the city and, hence, on the likelihood of achieving a just 
      society.</P>
      <P>Play is central to the interaction of the characters, the setting of 
      the dialogue and at all levels of learning in the <I>Republic</I>. Even 
      the most difficult and highest forms of philosophical investigation such 
      as dialectic &#151; the final stage in the education of philosophical rulers &#151;  
      are described as play (<I>paidia</I>) and the best form of education for 
      free citizens in a just society. Socrates is present in the dialogue as a 
      philosophical mentor of this play and a philosopher of the highest rank. 
      The sophists are Socrates' principal opposition and are represented by 
      Thrasymachos as a professional contender for the governance and rulership 
      of the city, an anti-hero for its youth, and a major player in the contest 
      for pedagogical supremacy in establishing a just city or a tyrannical one. 
      Others who join in the match, particularly Adeimantos and Glaucon, are 
      amateurs &#151; neither professional philosophers nor sophists. Hence they have 
      Socrates and Thrasymachos before them as pedagogical and leadership models 
      for playing the serious game of political life and as rival mentors in the 
      leading and education of its citizens. Thus, Socrates and Thrasymachos 
      represent opposing types of leadership and educational 
      approaches &#151; Thrasymachos as the overpowering tyrannical sophist, on the 
      one hand, and Socrates as the enabling philosopher and co-searcher of 
      wisdom, on the other. </P>
      <P><B>The Link between Education (<I>Paideia</I>) and Play 
      (<I>Paidia</I>)</B>.</P>
      <P>In Plato's <I>Republic</I>, an important link is established between 
      education/culture (<I>paideia</I>) and play/games (<I>paidia</I>), 
      beginning with children's (<I>paides</I>) musical and athletic 
      activities but continuing through the whole educational process 
      culminating in the dialectical "free-play" of the 
      philosopher king or queen. The evidence for this link between education 
      and play is considerable. L. Brandwood in his <I>A Word Index to Plato</I> 
      lists over 60 citations in the <I>Republic</I> to the noun variants of 
      "<I>paideia</I>" and to the verb form "<I>paideuein</I>" in 
	  reference to education/culture and the 
      educational process. <small><small>(13)</small></small> The references 
	  to play/game(s) in its noun 
      form &#151; "<I>paidia</I>" &#151; occurs over 25 times, and in its verbal 
      form &#151; "<I>paidzein</I>" &#151; over 8 times in the 
	  <I>Republic</I>. <small><small>(14)</small></small> Both 
      terms are linked with the education and activities of 
      children &#151; "<I>pais</I>" and "<I>paides</I>" &#151; but also with 
	  the education of dialectical 
      philosophers. Etymologically in Greek the terms "<I>paideia</I>," 
	  the word for education/culture, "<I>paidia</I>," the word for play/game/pastime/sport and 
      "<I>paides</I>" the word for children, have the same root, 
      and the three terms often show up in the same context.</P>
      <P>The educational play of children is central to the <I>Republic</I>; 
      however, there are also important connections between play and the 
      practice of dialectic of philosophers in the acquiring of a philosophical 
      education. <small><small>(15)</small></small> To understand the 
	  philosophical message of the <I>Republic</I> 
      requires giving close attention to the connection between 
      education/culture (<I>paideia</I>), and the pedagogical approach 
      (<I>paidagogia</I>) to teaching and learning that are to be carried out in 
      the community. The central aim of pedagogy (<I>paidagogia</I>) is to 
      encourage learning as a form of play (<I>paidia</I>), which is the most 
      persuasive and effective approach to learning for the free citizens in a 
      society which honors philosophers. <small><small>(16)</small></small> Socrates, 
	  who discusses with Glaucon 
      the importance of play in the education of the philosophical rulers in the 
      city, states in the <I>Republic</I>, 7.536e-f, that:</P>
	  <blockquote><P><small>"Well then, the study of calculation and geometry, 
      and all the preparatory education (<I>propaideuthenai</I>) required for 
      dialectic must be put before them as children (<I>paisin</I>), and the 
      instruction must not be given the aspect of a compulsion to 
      learn" (<I>ouk hos epanagkes mathein to schema tes 
      didaches</I>).</small></P>
      <P><small>"Why not?"</small></P>
      <P><small>"Because the free man (<I>eleutheron</I>) ought not 
      to learn any study slavishly. Forced labors performed by the body 
      don't make the body any worse, but no forced (<I>biaion</I>) 
	  study abides in the soul."</small></P>
      <P><small>"True," he said.</small></P>
      <P><small>"Therefore, you best of men," I said, 
      "don't use force (<I>bia</I>) in training the children (<I>paidas</I>) 
      in the subjects, but rather play (<I>paidzontas</I>). In that way you can 
      better discern what each is naturally directed toward."</small></P></blockquote>
      <P>Here Socrates presents the optimum approach to education as a 
      non-coercive play activity in which children are to participate freely 
      (7.536e). The term "freely" in this context does not imply that 
      educational play is unstructured and has no limits, since the freedom of 
      individuals in the <i>Republic</i> must be viewed within the limiting 
      context of the city (4.434a-e) and in the form of a more "law-abiding 
      play" (<I>ennomoterou...paidias</I>, 4.424d).</P>
      <P>Play appears, both as a method used in the instruction of learners as 
      well as an activity related to the educational context (6.497). Plato 
      distinguishes between play which is playful amusement (6.497a-e, 7.539b), 
      and the law-abiding play (<I>nomoterou...paidias</I>) which is serious 
      (<I>spoudaious</I>) (4. 424e-425a). Frivolous or non-serious play is the 
      play which diverts attention from the educational goal of the discovery of 
      the truth, and focusses on the dialectical activity as a sport or pastime 
      unrelated to the pursuit of the truth. Serious play concerns itself with 
      the goal of imbuing children's and learners' play (<I>paides 
      paidzein</I>, 4.424a) in music, stories and athletic games with good order 
      that fosters excellence in the education (<I>paideia</I>) of the young 
      (4.425a-b). The aim of the educational process is the fostering of the 
      growth and development of the learner toward the ultimate objective of the 
      individual's contribution to a good society and the vision of the Good itself. 
      By way of contrast, the sophists, as educators, focussed primarily on 
      refuting and contradicting their opponents in discourse &#151; a "base" form of play 
      which has lost sight of its aim &#151; the truth and the good.</P>
      <P>In our everyday usage, there is a tendency to treat the terms "play" 
      and "work" as opposites and, correspondingly, work is seen as serious and 
      play as frivolous. For Plato, however, play and work are not opposed to 
      each other, since play can be serious and useful when it contributes to 
      the educational process. Plato himself employs play with serious intent in 
      the education of potential philosophers when he uses an imaginative myth 
      to describe the education of learners as they move from an unenlightened 
      condition to enlightenment in the Myth of the Cave (7.514a-518b). 
      Moreover, dialectic, the final stage of education for philosopher-kings, 
      is seen as serious play which searches for the truth dialectically rather 
      than simply seeking to contradict opponents and refute them 
(7.539b-d).</P>
      <P>In the contrast between serious play and frivolous play, there lies a 
      value distinction between what may be termed "good play" and "bad play" 
      respectively. One is able to differentiate good and bad/base play 
      according to whether the activity relates to the ultimate end of 
      education, namely, the knowledge of the Good and the application of that 
      vision to day to day life in a good society. All forms of play which aim 
      at or lead toward this objective are considered good play. On the other 
      hand, "bad" play obscures and diverts the learner from striving toward the 
      final goal and is to be censored from the educational experience of 
      learners (2.376-3.412). A similar distinction between noble/good and 
      base/bad play is introduced by Socrates in connection with the 
      difficulties that philosophical leaders have in functioning justly in a 
      democratic regime when he says that </P>
      <blockquote><P><small>"...this [democratic] regime's sympathy and 
      total lack of pettiness in despising what we were saying so solemnly when 
      we were founding the city &#151; that unless a man has a transcendent nature he 
      would never become good (<I>agathos</I>) if from earliest childhood his 
      play (<I>paidzoi</I>) isn't noble (<I>en kalois</I>; beautiful) and all 
      his practices aren't such &#151; how magnificently it tramples all this 
      underfoot and doesn't care at all from what kinds of practices a 
      man goes to political action, but honors him if only he says 
      he's well disposed towards the multitude?"
      (8.558b)</small></P></blockquote>
      <P>Once again the contrast is between the noble play of philosophical 
      leaders and the base play of tyrannical leaders interested in the 
      manipulation and control of the crowd. </P>
      <P><B>Concluding Remarks.</B></P>
      <P>In summary, this paper has sketched briefly the important link and 
      significance of play (<I>paidia</I>) in the education/culture 
      (<I>paideia</I>) of the citizen and the community in Plato's <I>Republic</I> 
      and the contrasting educational approaches of sophistic coercion and 
      philosophical persuasion. Much more can be done to examine the relation 
      between play and education throughout the dialogue, to develop the 
      contrast between noble and base play, and to explore the contrasting 
      approaches to education and the development of political leaders through 
      the liberating play of dialectical philosophers, such as Socrates, versus 
      the forceful "play" of tyrannical sophists, such as 
      Thrasymachos.</P>

      <P>(1) The Greek title of Plato's work is the <I>Politeia</I> which reflects 
      the social and political context of the dialogue in connection with the 
      leadership of politicians "<I>politikoi</I>', and public 
      polity in the community and city (<I>polis</I>). These important 
      "political" connections are somewhat lost in the Latin 
      title "<I>Republic</I>" which is derived from "<I>res 
      publica</I>" and means "public 
      things" or "public matters," and in today's political 
      context suggests the political regime of a nation state. Unfortunately, 
      the title "Republic" for the imaginary city (<I>polis</I>) which 
      Socrates constructs "in words" (<I>logoi</I>) 
      is misleading if one imposes present political meanings of the term 
      "republic" for an understanding of Socrates' <I>polis</I> 
      constructed in Plato's dialogue of the 4th century B.C.E. Despite 
      this danger I will use the title "<I>Republic</I>" since it is the 
      title most commonly applied to this dialogue of Plato.</P>
      <P>(2) Much has been written in recent years about the importance of Plato's 
      dialogue form for an understanding of their philosophical import and the 
      reasons why this is important for the reading and interpretation of the 
      dialogues. For more on this issue see Arthur A. Krentz, "The Philosophical 
      Significance of the Form of Plato's Dialogues," <I>Philosophy and 
      Literature</I> , Vol. 7, No. 1 (April, 1983, 32-47, and A. Krentz, 
      "Dialogue and Dialectic: the Portrayal of Philosophy in Plato's

      XVII World Congress of</I> <I>Philosophy</I>, edited by V. Cauchy.

      <P>(5) The source of the light and the casting of the shadows in this 
      festival, and the fact that the dialogue occurs at night with the 
      assistance of lamplight and torchlight is also a significant parallel to 
      the parable of the myth of the cave. </P>

      (Savage, MD: Barnes and Noble, 1991), also treats the importance of 
	  space in connection with the playful 
      founding of a just society.</P>

      <P>(10) It is significant that, throughout the <I>Republic</I>, 
      Socrates always swears "by the dog!"--the most philosophical of 
      animals.</P>
      <P>(11) This struggle between philosophical persuasion and rhetorical force is 
      also reflected in the opening scene of the <I>Republic</I>. Socrates and 
      Glaucon, who are on their way from Piraeus to Athens, are seen by 
      Polemarchos "from a distance as [they] were hastening homeward" (1.327b). 
      Polemarchos orders his slave-boy (<I>paida</I>) to run and make them wait 
      for him; the slave caught hold of Socrates' cloak from behind and made him 
      stop, ordering him to wait. Polemarchos approached with Adeimantos and a 
      few others, whose names are mostly unmentioned and invites Socrates to his 
      home; Socrates indicates that he and Glaucon are heading back to Athens 
      and he wants to continue on their way. However, Polemarchos remarks that 
      Socrates "is outnumbered by those who are stronger and more forceful 
      (<I>kreittos</I>) than he is" (1.327c) and, hence, they are not likely to 
      be persuaded to let him go. Again a conflict is being introduced between 
      force and persuasion, between political tyranny and philosophical 
      dialogue. Physical violence and hostile quarrelling are allayed when 
      Socrates agrees to accompany the party to the house of Cephalos, 
      Polemarchos' father (1.328a-b). In the discussion of the Book I, Cephalos 
      is presented as a kind of elder statesman, now old and wealthy, and with a 
      traditional religious piety rooted in the advice of poets (1.329d-331e). 
      Cephalos, whose name means "chief" or "head" represents the power of 
      traditional religious, political and social authority, but he is soon to 
      be caught in the power struggle in Athens between the democrats and the 
      oligarches &#151; a struggle which will bring about the demise of his family and 
      the death of his sons, Polemarchos and Nicias. See Adi Opher, 
      <I>op.cit</I>., pp.118-9.</P>
      <P>(12) Socrates, in the <I>Symposium</I>, argues that the best 
      playwrights, whether comedians or tragedians, ought to be equally adept at 
      writing comedy or tragedy, and cast their works as comic-tragedies or 
      tragi-comedies. <I>The Republic</I>, in its account of the justice 
      and injustice in the city and the lives of citizens, obviously takes the 
      Socratic injunction seriously, thoroughly integrating playful comedy and 
      serious tragedy in the dramatic setting and the philosophical content of 
      the dialogue, and in the discussion of justice and injustice in the city 
      and on the lives of its citizens.</P>

      <P>(15) Huizinga, <I>op.cit</I>., p. 5. Huizinga maintains that play and 
      culture "are interwoven with one another" and that 
      "genuine, pure play is one of the main bases of 
      civilization."</P>
      <P>(16) Perhaps the most extensive treatment of the focus on education and 
      culture (<I>paideia</I>) is the work of Werner Jaeger, <I>Paideia: The 
      Ideals of Greek Culture</I>, 3 Vols. tr. by Gilbert Highet. (New York: 
      Oxford University Press, 1965). Adi Opher, <I>Plato's Invisible 
      Cities: Discourse and Power in the Republic</I> (Savage,MD: 
      Barnes &amp; Noble, 1991) also gives an interesting treatment of the 
      importance of space in connection with the activity of play as essential 
      to the founding of a just society.</P>
