<P><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Terms</span></b>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> are words
  or phrases that designate classes.</span></p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>General terms</span>
</b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> designate classes with
more than one member, e.g., common
  nouns such as “book” or “tree.”</span></p>
<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Singular terms</span>
</b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> designate individuals,
e.g., proper nouns (“The Taj
  Mahal”), or proper names (“Princess Diana”).</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Non-denoting terms refer to
the empty class
  (also known as the “null set”), e.g., “mermaid.”</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;'>The </span><b>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>denotation</span></b>
<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> of a term is, for general terms,
the class of things
  in the world to which the term correctly applies. For example, the denotation
  of the term “book” is all the books. Philosophical synonyms for “denotation”
  are “reference” and “extension.” </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;'>The </span><b><span style=
'font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>connotation
  </span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>of a term is
  </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>
  the list of membership conditions for the denotation. Philosophical synonyms
  for “connotation” are “sense,” “intension,” and “real definition.” Note this
  sense of “connotation” differs from the literary sense.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The connotation of the
general term “square”
  is “rectangular and equilateral.”</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The denotation of the
general term “square”
  is all squares.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A <b>closed concept</b>
is one for which it is possible to precisely specify
  the connotation. The concept “square” is closed. The set of squares has two
  membership conditions: equilaterality and rectangularity. For something to be
  in the denotation of “square,” it must satisfy both conditions; in other words,
  it must be both equilateral and rectangular. Each condition is necessary and
  together the conditions are sufficient to make something a member of the
  denotation
  of “square.” </span> </p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Few concepts are closed.
<i>Most concepts are
  open. This is not a big deal. </i></span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An <b>open concept</b> is
one for which the connotation cannot be precisely
  specified; rather, we recognize members of the class by their resemblance to
  <b>paradigms</b> of the concept.</span>   </p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Example: “disabled person”
</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We know the paradigms of
disabled persons (people
  like Stephen Hawking and Christopher Reeve), and we judge whether or not
  another
  individual should be called “disabled” on the basis of the resemblance between
  this person and the paradigms. (I.e., we argue by analogy.)</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>NOTE: When we say that
the concept “disabled
  person” is open, we mean simply that it is hard to decide in some cases whether
  that concept should be applied to an individual person. We do NOT mean to say
  that the concept is useless. Just because it’s hard to say in some cases doesn’t
  mean there’s no such thing as a disabled person! Arguing that way would be
  committing
  the continuum fallacy (see below).</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>All the interesting social,
legal, and philosophical
  notions are open, and require argument by analogy to decide borderline cases:
  “person,” “good,” “religion,” “rich,” “sexual harassment,” “obscenity,” “minority,”
  etc. Such argument is important because it matters what we call things. </span>
  </p>


<hr>
  <P><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<b>The Continuum Fallacy</b> consists in  arguing that a concept is useless or a
debate
    is pointless because some of the key concepts in the discussion cannot be
    defined precisely. The phrase often heard in continuum fallacies is “Where
    do you draw the line?”</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For example: “I don’t see
how you can argue
  for accommodating people with disabilities. Where do you draw the line between
  disabled and able-bodied people? You can’t draw the line precisely. So the whole
  debate about accommodating people with disabilities is pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A variant of the continuum
fallacy is arguing
  that if you can’t draw the line precisely between X and non-X, <i>there’s no
  distinction</i> at all between X and non-X. This is exemplified in the famous
  argument of the beard. We think there’s a difference between having a beard
  and not having a beard. We also think it’s possible for a man who doesn’t have
  a beard to have a beard at a later time. But the argument of the beard says
  a man who doesn’t have a beard can <i>never</i> have one, since it’s not
  possible
  to say exactly where to draw the line between a beard and a non-beard:</span>
  </p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>“If a man has one whisker
on his face, he doesn’t
  have a beard. If he grows a second whisker, he still doesn’t have a beard. A
  third whisker won’t give him a beard either. So it doesn’t matter how many
  whiskers
  a man has: he still won’t have a beard.”</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another example of the
continuum fallacy: “Smoking one cigarette won’t harm
  my health. And two cigarettes is only one more than one. So the second cigarette
  won’t hurt me.  And three cigarettes is only one more than two.  So that third
  cigarette won’t hurt me either. Where do you draw the line? You can’t. So I
  can smoke as many cigarettes as I want and it won’t ever hurt me.”</span></p>

  <P><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Defining Our Terms
  </span></b>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>People who commit the
Continuum Fallacy often
  think they have won the argument by showing that a concept is open. For
  example,
  people sometimes argue that all questions of obscenity or sexual harassment
  or date rape or disability are nonsense, because people can’t say in every case
  what counts as obscenity or sexual harassment or date rape or disability. These
  are open concepts with fuzzy borders, and as society changes, those borders
  can change. So we can’t draw the line precisely. Suppose you point this out.
  The person committing the continuum fallacy now thinks she has triumphed. She
  says, “Well, since you can’t draw the line precisely, you don’t really know
  what you’re talking about at all. You must define your terms, you know. We can’t
  begin to discuss something we can’t define.” </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But this is nonsense, no?
We can and do engage
  in meaningful debate about the application of open concepts. That is the center
  of law and philosophy. You should answer, “I can’t draw the line precisely,
  <i>and I don’t have to.</i> An open concept is still meaningful!”</span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It’s important to realize
that open concepts
  are normal and useful, even if we can’t define them as precisely as we can define
  closed concepts. It IS important to define terms when we argue. But sometimes
  we have to settle disputes about paradigms before we can begin to argue specific
  cases. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For example, suppose you
are debating someone
  over whether people with perfume allergies should count as disabled. You say,
  “Well, people with perfume allergies are certainly much less disabled than people
  like Christopher Reeve or Stephen Hawking. People with perfume allergies can
  still move their arms and legs at will. If they’re disabled, they’re certainly
  not severely disabled.” Now suppose your opponent says, “Christopher Reeve isn’t
  disabled at all! He can do anything he wants – in his mind! In fact, no one
  who can think is disabled, because thoughts are free!” </span></p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Clearly, you and your
opponent are using very different definitions of “disability”
  – different paradigms.  You’re not going to get anywhere if you don’t first
  come to some agreement about the paradigm cases. That’s where it’s important
  to “define your terms.”  What does your opponent think “disabled” means? The
  burden of proof is on your opponent in this case to argue for his notion of
  disability. He must show first that it makes sense (is any conscious person
  disabled, on his view? if no one counts as disabled, does the term “disabled”
  mean anything anymore?).</span> </p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>People are of course free to
use words any way
  they like. But in contexts where argument matters – in the university, in science,
  and in public life – people must defend their eccentric word usage with arguments.
  In other words, people must give good reasons.</span></p>
