      <B><i>A priori
      </i>and <i>a posteriori</i></b>
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      (This is review, but some students need to read this again!)
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      The expressions “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a
        priori</i>” and “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a posteriori</i>”
        are Latin idioms. They are phrases and function as adjectives or adverbs.
        That is, they modify a noun (such as “knowledge,” “statement,”
        or “claim”), a verb (such as "know") or an adjective (such as “true” or
        “false”). The “<i>a</i>”
        in these expressions is the Latin preposition meaning “from.”  So “<i>a
        priori</i>” means “from before [observation]” and “<i>a
        posteriori</i>” means “from after [observation]”. The expressions “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i>” and “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>a posteriori</i>” describe <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how we
        know</i> the truth or falsity of a statement.</span></p>
      <p></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>A statement is true or false <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>a priori</i> if no observation or experiment is required to determine
        if it is true or false. Examples of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a
        priori</i> statements are mathematical assertions, statements true or
        false by definition, and logical truths and falsehoods. We “just know”
        when some claims are <i>a priori</i> true or false. For example, we “just
        know” that the same statement cannot be both true and false in the same
        sense at the same time (a rule of logic called the law of non-contradiction).
        </span></p>

font-family:Verdana'>A statement is true or false <i>a posteriori</i> if observation
        or experiment is required to determine if it is true or false; we don’t

        the world, e.g., “Dogs are carnivores” or “Ottawa is the capitol of Canada.”

      <p class=MsoTitle1>Meditation I</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Descartes describes his method of systematic doubt (aka
“methodological
        doubt”): he will claim to know only that which he cannot doubt (that which
        is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>indubitable</i>). Descartes succeeds
        in doubting both <i>a posteriori</I> and <i>a priori</I> statements, in the
        following order:
        <P>
        <ol><span style='font-family:Verdana'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>
        <LI><p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a posteriori</i>
        statements:<P>
        <UL>
        <LI>
      "My senses are reliable."  <P><p class=MsoNormal>Descartes wonders how he "really
knows" this; he asks if  his senses may not be systematically deceiving him.
<LI>
    "I am awake."  <P><p class=MsoNormal>Descartes asks how he really knows this, and
wonders if he may not be dreaming.<P>
</UL>
<LI>
      <p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i>
statements:</span></p>
<UL>
<LI>
      <p class=MsoNormal>"Mathematical statements (such as the statement "2+3=5") are true."<P><p
      class=MsoNormal>
Descartes realizes that while such statements seem indubitable, they might seem
indubitable only because an all-powerful evil deceiving God is making them seem
indubitable.<P>
<LI>
<p class=MsoNormal> "God is not a deceiver." <P><p class=MsoNormal> Of course, the ultimately clever
deceiver God would want me to think this ... </p>
</UL>
</OL>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Note that Descartes can doubt math only by supposing God
        to be a deceiver. If God is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a deceiver, in other words, math is
        indubitable. </span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if
		!supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class=MsoTitle1>The Overall Argument of the <I>Meditations</i></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>The general strategy of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Meditations</i> can now be stated.  If Descartes can prove that God exists and is
        not a deceiver, math knowledge will be restored. If math knowledge is
        restored, then Descartes can attain knowledge of the external world (if
        there is one) <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as that world is known through math</i>, i.e.,
        knowledge of its measurable, objective qualities. Math is the language of science.  So if math can be known,
        scientific knowledge really is genuine!
        <p class=MsoNormal>A lot of our ordinary experience isn't science, though.
        We "just feel" a lot of stuff, e.g., pleasure and pain, and our feelings are private. Science
        can't access our private feelings to measure them,
        so the certainty of math doesn't help here.
       Pleasure, in particular, creates moral challenges for people. The subjective non-mathematical
        sensory world is still potentially deceptive; what feels right isn't always what is right.
        This is where the Church comes in. Since many of people's sense experiences are  still
        liable to be deceptive, people will forever be in need of guidance
        and correction by the Church.</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>In this way, Descartes convinces the Church that it has nothing to
        fear from science, since scientists themselves, whether they know it or not, have to trust God for
        their mathematically certainty. Furthermore, the Church's crucial role in areas of faith and conscience
        remains exactly the same: the Church still rules in areas of ethics and religion.
        <p class=MsoNormal>Thus
        Descartes reconciled the Church and the new science &mdash; so much so that the Catholic Church never
        seriously quarreled with science again. Catholics have never opposed evolution, for example, and
        Catholic universities have the same science curricula as secular universities.
<p class=MsoNormal>
Let's continue with the details of Descartes' argument, then.

      <p class=MsoTitle1>Meditation II</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Descartes realizes he has one indubitable idea that withstands
        even the evil demon conjecture: that he exists (which remains true even
        if he is being deceived).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I think,

<p class=MsoNormal>
<i>Ergo Sum</i><br>
(Sung to the Beach Boys' <I>In My Room</i>)
<p class=MsoNormal>
Descartes sat and meditated,
<br>and thus cogito'ed --
<br>ergo sum, ergo sum.<br>
Doubting all he took as granted<br> forced him to conclude -- <br>ergo sum, ergo
sum.<br>
<p class=MsoNormal>
It took four more meditations<br> for the world to bloom --<br>
proving God deposed deception <br>(with distinctness too!).<br>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<I>--- End of break  ---</I>
<hr>
<P>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Descartes now knows he exists, but only as a thinking thing,
and <I>not</I> as
        a body. Descartes believes that a person is made up of two separate and distinct kinds of
        substance — material substance (called <I>res extensa</i>) and thinking substance
        (<I>res cogitans</i>).  (Descartes assumes bodies can't think. Is this a reasonable assumption?) The view
        that reality comprises two
        separate and incompatible kinds of substance has come to be known as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>
        Cartesian dualism</i>.
       <p class=MsoNormal>
       Cartesian dualism gives rise to the notorious
       <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>
        mind-body
        problem</i> — the problem of how to explain exactly how these two kinds of incompatible
        and opposite being interact in a person.  We will explore alternatives to Cartesian dualism in the materials for
        Quiz 7.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>argument of the
        wax</i> shows Descartes that he has other indubitable ideas also. He knows
        that wax is the same although all its sense data change: that this substance
        is continuous (the same) through time. His sense data (which have
        completely
        changed) do not tell him this. He “just knows” substantiality (thingness)
        and sameness (identity).</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Thus by the end of Meditation II, Descartes thinks he knows
        three things for certain: (1) his own existence <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>qua</i> thinking thing, and the concepts of (2) substance and (3) identity.
        He still does not know if any substances exist.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'><![if
!supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <P CLASS=MsoTitle1>Meditations III - V</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      Descartes gives arguments that attempt to prove the
existence
        of a non-deceiving God. Since Descartes still isn’t sure there is anything
        outside his mind, his arguments for God must be completely <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i>, i.e., not derived from any facts
        about the cosmos. The most important of Descartes’ arguments for God is
        the <a href="ONTARG.HTM">Ontological Argument</a> in Meditation V, which we will analyze later in the semester.
        </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>If God is not a deceiver, then Descartes gets math knowledge
        back — note, math knowledge only, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>not ordinary non-mathematical sense knowledge</span>. He needs a
separate
        argument to show that he can trust his senses. He gives that argument
        in Meditation VI.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><![if
!supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class=MsoTitle1>Meditation VI </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Here Descartes gives his argument that he is distinct from
        his body and can exist without it (thus proving that personal immortality
        is possible). Here’s the argument: Descartes knows clearly and distinctly
        of himself that he is a thinking thing; yet his idea of body is clearly
        different. In fact, his idea of body is incompatible with thinking; in
        Descartes’ mind, the idea of “thinking body” is simply self-contradictory.
        (Is this argument convincing?)</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Next Descartes shows that material (“corporeal”) things do
        exist and that he can therefore trust his senses to some degree. But
        Descartes
        will not abandon the method of systematic doubt even at this late point
        in the argument; he will allow only what he cannot doubt, and he sees
        that the ordinary senses are still liable to error. For example, we see
        a white object as red if a red light is illuminating it; we may fail to
        savor the taste of food if we have a bad cold. He concludes that he can
        know the material world with certainty only as it is ”the object of pure
        mathematics.” Descartes introduces a distinction between objectively
        measurable
        properties of things (like size, shape, and weight – what John Locke will
        call <i>primary</i> qualities) and “subjective” non-measurable properties
        (like color, smell and taste – what Locke will call <i>secondary</i> qualities).
        We can only really know the objective, quantifiable stuff. This just happens
        to be exactly the stuff that is vital for the new mathematically-grounded
        sciences.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Descartes’ conclusion made everyone happy: the Church had
        nothing to fear from science.</p>
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li> <p class=MsoNormal>Subjective sense experience is still liable to error, so
          people still need the Church. The Church rules in the realm of SOUL.
          <br>
          </li><P>
      <li> <p class=MsoNormal>Science rules in the realm of BODY — external objects as measured and
quantified
        by math — but only because the certainty of science depends on the
        existence
        of a non-deceiving God. Whether they admit it or not, scientists depend
        on God.</li>
