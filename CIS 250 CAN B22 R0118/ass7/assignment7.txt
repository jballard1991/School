// 2. Write a void function definition for a function called zeroBoth that has two call-by-reference parameters, both of which are variables of type int, and sets the values of both variables to 0.

void zeroBoth(int &a,int &b) {
	a = 0;
	b = 0;
}

//q3 3. Write a void function definition for a function called addTax. The function addTax has two formal parameters: taxRate, which his the amount of sales tax expressed as a percentage; and cost, which is the cost of an item before tax. The function changes the value of cost so that it includes sales tax.

void addTax(float taxRate, float cost) {
	cost = cost + (cost * taxRate);
}
