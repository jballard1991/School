      <p class=MsoNormal>Philosophers sometimes
        say there are basically two kinds of philosophy — speculative philosophy
        and analytic philosophy. Speculative philosophy is, as you might guess,
        concerned with speculation. It is characterized by concern for the “big
        problems” — e.g., meaning of life, why is there something rather than
        nothing. It features “broad brush strokes of thought.” Speculative philosophers
        tend not to express their views in argument form with premises and conclusions,
        and to use poetic and vague language freely.
      <p class=MsoNormal>Analytic philosophy is
        sometimes called critical philosophy. Analytic philosophers tend to tackle
        problems more modestly and systematically, and build large systems up
        from numerous well-constructed components. They tend to be philosophically
        economical — they don’t buy concepts they don't absolutely need, in accordance
        with a principle called “Ockham’s Razor.” They look for provability. They
        are suspicious of poetic language.
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      Plato, Aristotle's teacher,
        tends to be a speculative thinker. Aristotle is  the first great
        analytic philosopher.
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)
        was a student of Plato. Aristotle spent 20 years in Plato's Academy until
        Plato's death. Then he left, tutored Alexander the Great for a few years,
        and eventually started his own school (the Lyceum) in Athens.
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      For sheer breadth of
        work, Aristotle stands out. Most other philosophers are famous for one
        or two areas of philosophy, e.g., Aquinas for philosophy of religion,
        Descartes for metaphysics, J. S. Mill and Hobbes for political philosophy.
        Aristotle, by contrast, had his hands in everything.
      <p class=MsoNormal>
      <OL>
      <span style='font-size:10.0pt'>
      <LI><p class=MsoNormal>Logic: Aristotle invented formal
        logic. Aristotle's logic basically <i>was</i> formal logic till the early 20th
        century. If Aristotle had never done anything but invent logic, his place
        in the history of philosophy would be assured.<p class=MsoNormal>
      <LI><p class=MsoNormal>
      Aesthetics: Aristotle’s
        <i>Poetics</i> presented his theory of tragedy, including the notion of
        catharsis.<p class=MsoNormal>
        <LI><p class=MsoNormal>
        Ethics: Aristotle’s “virtue
        ethics” is enjoying a revival in ethics in the last thirty years. His
        doctrine of virtue as the Golden Mean is quite famous.<p class=MsoNormal>
      <LI><p class=MsoNormal>
      Philosophy of Religion:
        Aristotle proposed several arguments for the existence of God. Of course,
        Aristotle was not arguing for the God of Christianity or Judaism, since
        Aristotle probably knew nothing of the Jews and predated Jesus by several
        centuries. But Medieval Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas
        were excited by the idea of using rational arguments to prove the existence
        of the Christian God and they used Aristotle’s arguments for that purpose.<p class=MsoNormal>
        <LI><p class=MsoNormal>
        Science: Until Copernicus
        and Galileo — i.e. until the late Renaissance — Aristotle's cosmology
        was accepted throughout the West. Aristotle’s cosmology was <i>geocentric</i>:
        it held that the earth was the center of the universe.<p class=MsoNormal>
      <LI><p class=MsoNormal>
      Metaphysics and Epistemology:
        Aristotle rejected Plato's doctrine of transcendent Forms. Much of the
        basic vocabulary of Western philosophy comes from Aristotle — the Four
        Causes, Substance and Accident, Potency and Act, Form and Matter. Soul
        is to body as Form is to matter.
        </OL>
        <p class=MsoNormal>To get an idea of the
        flavor of Aristotle's philosophy, it's instructive to contrast it to Plato.
        Some people say Plato is a poet, while Aristotle is an engineer; or Plato
        is a dreamer, while Aristotle is a practical man; or Plato is a rationalist
        (stressing the power of reason unaided by experience to grasp substantial
        truths about the world), while Aristotle is an empiricist (stressing knowledge
        from experience).
        <p class=MsoNormal>
        Let’s contrast the views
        of Plato and Aristotle on three key questions:
        <p class=MsoNormal>
        <OL><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>
        <LI><p class=MsoNormal>In ethics, the question
        of the relationship between virtue and happiness.
        <LI><p class=MsoNormal>In psychology (Philosophy
        of Mind), the relationship of the mind and body.
        <LI><p class=MsoNormal>In metaphysics, the question
        of “where” the Forms are.
        </OL>
        <p class=MsoNormal>Regarding ethics, Plato
        says virtue is sufficient for happiness, while Aristotle says virtue is
        necessary for happiness.
        <p class=MsoNormal>Regarding psychology,
        Plato sees the body as a “prison” for the soul. For Plato, the life of
        the soul in the body is contrary to its nature. So Plato is a dualist
        with respect to this question. Body and soul are radically different kinds
        of things, capable of existing separately, and it's assumed that the soul
        is superior to the body.
        <p class=MsoNormal>For Aristotle, body and
        soul are different kinds of things, because one, the body, is matter,
        and the other, the soul, is form. But this is not to say the body is a
        prison, or that the soul is “better” than the body. Everything in the
        universe is composed of matter and form, so it's not surprising that persons
        are too. Form is simply the way matter is put together. Dogs are put together
        in a doggy way; that’s what makes them dogs. Rocks are put together in
        a rock-ish way; that’s why they’re rocks. Persons have a special mode
        of organization, too; that’s their Form. In fact, nothing can exist in
        our world which is NOT both matter and form. Everything is something;
        in other words, everything that is in our world is matter organized in
        a certain way. Take away the organization and the thing <i>isn’t anything</i>
        any more; it ceases to be, since for Aristotle, to be is to be something,
        and to be something is to have a certain form. So for Aristotle, the concept
        of soul without body or body without soul is incoherent. We should note
        that Aristotle himself was not happy with this answer and argued that
        souls <i>might</i> be able to exist without bodies; but he never concludes
        they do.
        <p class=MsoNormal>You can think of the
        difference between Plato and Aristotle on this subject in sci-fi terms.
        When people talk about souls inhabiting different bodies, like in Steve
        Martin's movie <i>All of Me</i>, they are being Platonists. Aristotle
        would not understand this at all.
        <p class=MsoNormal>
        Regarding Forms, then,
        Plato explained how things are the way they are (like the question “Why
        is the frying pan a frying pan and not something else?”) using poetic
        and vague language. He talks about things “imitating,” or “participating
        in,” or “reproducing” Forms, which are like ideal models of things, e.g.
        the frying pan imitates the ideal frying pan. Plato talks as though the
        Forms actually exist, though it's not clear “where” or how.
      <p class=MsoNormal>Aristotle is more philosophically
        economical than Plato; he tends to get rid of concepts he thinks are unnecessary,
        and he thinks the notion of Forms existing apart from things (<i>transcendently</i>)
        is superfluous. Aristotle moves the forms right into the things; he makes
        them <i>immanent</i>. The frying pan is a frying pan because it has a
        material part (the metal) and a form (“frying pan-ness”). Frying pan-ness
        is not “out there” somewhere.
      <p class=MsoNormal>To sum up, you can see
        Aristotle as someone who finds the world terribly interesting just as
        it is. His focus is always on explaining things in a way consistent with
        experience, without introducing extra fantastical notions that can't be
        proved. I think of Aristotle as a kid from the sticks who entered Plato's
        Academy as an outsider, and always remained an outsider, because he just
        couldn't shake that empirical, practical bent. He's rather like the Lt.
        Columbo of Ancient Greek philosophy. Aristotle has the engineer's temperament;
        he likes to get things clear and solve problems. Plato's vague, poetic
        language in metaphysics and ethics didn't inspire Aristotle; it made him
        uncomfortable. And this made Aristotle produce one of the great systems
        of Western philosophy.
