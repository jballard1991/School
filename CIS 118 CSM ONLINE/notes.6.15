Lecture 1: 6/15/2015 - CAN Library

Focused on mastering Concepts in Computer Science

First lession: The Crow

Crows suck and their memory sucks. They can only remember 3 people in an arbitrary, non scientific test.

Assignment 1:

* How many blocks can I visualize in my minds eye at once? About 4. Wow, i'm a crow. How objective.

Lecture continues to conjecture about metaphorical phychological pedantry, to explain programming is the same as learning new languages or concepts... how novel.

Professor defines some phrases and concepts, such as the word concept. 

Conceptual Hirearchy:

A tree of properties, with each node below the last.

Assignment 2:

* 1) The first level, or lowest level concept is a physical observable thing. 
	(A) In the chart it is a table. 
	(B) The highest level concept in the chart is Existent, if I can read it right.
* 2) Draw a conceptual hierarchy of my choosing:
1st	Cell Phone+ Tablet/Computer/Smartwatch
2nd	          +->Electronic Device+
3rd		                      +->Machine+
4th					        +-> Complex Tool

TODO: Reread lesson, create formal assignment submission

**BREAK OCCURS HERE**

Digits come from india

They kick ass, and fuck shit up heavyhardcore compared to numerals. Digits use a single character to symbolize multiple items, a solution to the crow problem.

ASSIGNMENT:

> Explain how the base 8, Octal numbering systems work.
	Octal is a number system that uses a positional notation based on 8. The symbol set includes the characters 01234567, with 8 being represented as one and then zero, meaning an increment of the position. 
	For example, the number 123 in octal is represented 173. Broken down by place:
base10:
---	--	-
1	2	3 =	100 + 20 + 3 = 123 

base8:
---	--	-
1	7	3 =	100(64 in base10) + 70(56 in base10) + 3(also 3 in base10) = 	173(base8) 123(base10)

> Convert Octal 7777 to binary, decimal and Hexadecimal.

> What really are the 1’s and 0’s of digital devices ?
Transistors representing on and off states

> What is the history of the base 60 number system ?
Base60 was used by the ancient Babylonians 

> How do you use the base 60 number system today ?
To represent time, minutes in an hour.

> Who used the binary number system first ?
A french man named Gottfried Leibniz published the first known use of binary in 1679

> Why are digital electronic designs used more commonly then analog electronic designs ?
It is much quicker and easier to design, prototype and produce models digitally than to rely on analog design, especially when the costs to manufacture are so low these days.
