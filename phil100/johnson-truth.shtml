<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">This paper will
deal with the explication of the concept of “Truth as Subjectivity”, which is
found in Soren Kierkegaard’s magnum opus <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript
To The Philosophical Fragments</i>, written in 1846 from Copenhagen, Denmark
and published in English by David Swenson in 1941.&nbsp; So captivating a piece of
philosophical literature that its first English translator, David Swenson,
while a graduate student in philosophy, happened upon a copy of the text in
Danish at a public library and took it home and read it in its entirety in the
next twenty-four hours.&nbsp; Kierkegaard’s thought is truly unique, challenging,
and rewarding at the same time.&nbsp; For the purposes of this paper, I will focus
primarily on those portions of the <i>Postscript</i> that deal with the meaning
of “Truth as Subjectivity”.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Some background on Kierkegaard’s life is on order before proceeding to expound
his thought on the subjectivity as truth section of the <i>Postscript</i>.&nbsp;
Kierkegaard stands squarely in the Christian tradition of faith in Jesus Christ
as the only means of personal salvation.&nbsp; Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) was an
Existentialist, although that description was applied to his thought
posthumously.&nbsp; Existentialism can best be described as a mood within philosophy
that emphasizes the concrete and particular existence of man in the world.&nbsp;
Later Existentialists described man as having no essence but only existence.&nbsp;
As it pertains to Christianity, Kierkegaard’s thought was instrumental in
defining a way of being in the world that is characterized by an insistence on
an individual and deeply personal experience leading to religious truth.&nbsp; This
religious experience is characterized by a highly subjective awareness of truth
within one’s own individual existence.&nbsp; His early writings addressed these
topics indirectly, ironically, and pseudonymously.&nbsp; These pseudonymous writings
often took positions that were later explained by Kierkegaard himself as being
contrary to his personal belief.&nbsp; He did this in order to expose the fallacy of
these viewpoints.&nbsp; Kierkegaard’s philosophical goals could be described as
twofold: trying to find a way of realizing an authentic religious experience
that was not subject to the rigorous rationalism prevalent during his time, and
doing away with systematic philosophizing altogether.&nbsp; The latter was in direct
opposition to Hegel’s rational idealism.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[1]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Some preliminary information
concerning the concepts of knowledge, called epistemology in philosophy, must
be supplied before we get into the more difficult ideas expounded by
Kierkegaard.&nbsp; The nature of truth has been debated throughout the history of
philosophy and theology.&nbsp; Since at least the time of the Greeks, primarily in
the West, truth has generally been defined as falling into either of two
categories: the objective and the subjective.&nbsp; Whether or not these two terms
were actually used in philosophical discussion is debatable, but for our
purposes in this paper it will suffice to make this broad generalization.&nbsp; The
basic argument put forth in this paper, which I believe will be shown to also
be that of Kierkegaard’s, is that truth in general can be conceived of as
having a dual existence.&nbsp; In other words, truth can be seen as both objective
AND subjective—a sort of split personality.&nbsp; These two terms need to be defined
before we can proceed with the explanation of the concept of subjective truth
in Kierkegaard.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">The term
“objective” signifies the dispassionate and theoretical knowledge one can
attain about the world, or in this case, knowledge of God and/or Christianity.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[2]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
To be objective is to employ empirical, rational, and scientific methods of
inquiry to the topic of discussion, or if you will, any given subject under
consideration.&nbsp; On the other hand, the term subjective signifies the personal,
passionate, and practical approach to knowledge.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">In addition,
something needs to be said about what one might call Kierkegaard’s
“existential” approach to knowledge.&nbsp; Existentialism is more like a mood than a
philosophical system.&nbsp; In fact, against the Hegelians, which prompted the <i>Postscript</i>
in the first place, Kierkegaard declared adamantly that an existential system was
impossible.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[3]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
Rather, the existential approach within Kierkegaard’s writings serves more like
a method than a description of strictly held beliefs.&nbsp; This is important
because it really is Kierkegaard’s unique perspective and emphasis on man as an
existing individual that leads to his subjective basis for truth.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Thus I always
reason from existence, not toward existence, whether I move in the sphere of
palpable fact or in the realm of thought.&nbsp; I do not, for example prove that a
stone exists, but that some existing thing is a stone.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[4]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">But Kierkegaard
gives us a working definition, or rather description, of what has come to be
understood when we use the term “existential”: </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">That essential
knowledge is essentially related to existence does not mean the above mentioned
identity which abstract thought postulates between thought and being; nor does
it signify, objectively, that knowledge corresponds to something existent as
its object.&nbsp; <i>But it means that knowledge has a relationship to the knower,
who is essentially an existing individual, and that for this reason all
essential knowledge is essentially related to existence</i>.&nbsp; Only ethical and
ethico-religious knowledge has an essential relationship to the existence of
the knower. <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[5]</span></span></span></a>
(italics added)</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Furthermore, to be
subjective implies the initiation of a “decisive and free agent of choice” into
the inquiry of the topic under consideration.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[6]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
One must be engaged or “choose sides” in order to be subjective.&nbsp; One would
employ the faculties of their emotions, will, and feelings as an existing
subject in the quest for truth.&nbsp; In other words, in order to become subjective
one must first recognize and come to terms with one's own existence and what
constitutes it.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Also,
Kierkegaard’s concept of subjectivity and thinking in general must be
understood.&nbsp; For Kierkegaard, there are two alternatives to reflection.&nbsp; In
other words, one can think about anything in two ways, an objective way or a
subjective way.&nbsp; He calls these an objective reflection and a subjective reflection.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[7]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
And existence itself is the divider of these two opposing modes of reflection.&nbsp;
In other words, to be an existing individual, which Kierkegaard said he was
only a poor one and indeed we all are, is to “be” and “not be” at the same
time.&nbsp; Or to say it another way, existence itself is a process of “becoming.”&nbsp;
Existence itself automatically raises the question of exactly what one may
become.&nbsp; According to Kierkegaard, uncertainty is a hallmark of human
existence.&nbsp; He writes, </font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">An Existing
individual is constantly in process of becoming; the actual existing subjective
thinker constantly reproduces this existential situation in his thoughts, and
translates all his thinking into terms of process.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[8]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial"><b>Concept of Truth in Kierkegaard's <i>Postscript</i></b></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Furthermore, Kierkegaard
implies in the <i>Postscript</i>, whether purposely or not, the “mode” or
“method” of becoming subjective can be communicated, but not the content.&nbsp; What
Kierkegaard is interested in doing is explaining what becoming subjective looks
like, or perhaps what it is like for the subjective thinker.&nbsp; This he can tell
us because he himself is a subjective thinker.&nbsp; He is a particular existing
individual.&nbsp; So, he can tell us only how <i>this</i> particular existing
individual, himself, is thinking and feeling, not <i>what</i> he is thinking
and understanding, but <i>how</i> he is subjectively thinking and
understanding.&nbsp; He explains this by saying, “The objective accent falls on WHAT
is said, the subjective accent on HOW it is said.”<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[9]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
Furthermore, in this section of the Postscript Kierkegaard gives his own now
famous, or should we say infamous, definition of truth: </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Here is such a
definition of truth: <i>An objective uncertainty held fast in an
appropriation-process of the most passionate inwardness is the truth</i>, the
highest truth attainable for an <i>existing </i>individual.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[10]</span></span></span></a>
(italics original)</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">One of the most
controversial proclamations made by Kierkegaard in the <i>Postscript</i> is
that in order to truly become a Christian, one must first become subjective.&nbsp;
This claim is controversial because it seems to go against the generally
accepted meaning of scriptures that state simply what one must do in order to
be saved, or become a Christian.&nbsp; For example, </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">He then brought
them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” &nbsp;They
replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your
household.” <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[11]</span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">That if you
confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God
raised him from the dead, you will be saved. &nbsp;For it is with your
heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you
confess and are saved.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[12]</span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">…for, “Everyone
who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[13]</span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">For it is by
grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is
the gift of God— <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[14]</span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Even
though we are not concerned with Kierkegaard’s soteriology in this paper,
nevertheless these verses indicate the nature of salvation is initially an
ascent of the rational mind, or at least the human will, to believe.&nbsp; This
constitutes salvation.&nbsp; However, Kierkegaard seems to indicate that what is
required is not salvation as such, but subjectivity in becoming “contemporary
with Christ”, which leads to an “eternal happiness”.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[15]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Furthermore, a
problematic point of what Kierkegaard seems to be saying is that what one must
do is to arrive at a certain preliminary stage in order to become a Christian.&nbsp;
He states that one must become subjective in order to arrive at the truth, or
to be “in” the truth.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[16]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
While there are strong points in his approach to the analysis of the benefits,
or even necessity, of becoming subjective, and his emphasis on the relational
aspects of truth are very enlightening, there are ramifications that are
troublesome.&nbsp; Mainly, these problems could be summed up by saying that
Kierkegaard introduces an extra biblical criteria for becoming a Christian into
his philosophy of subjective truth.&nbsp; Perhaps, it would have been better for
Kierkegaard to acknowledge that there seems to be a preliminary, and one might
even say necessary, stage or mindset to be attained before one can make the
leap to becoming a Christian.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[17]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
Nonetheless, Kierkegaard’s great contribution to the understanding of religious
faith lies in his explanation of the necessity of each particular, existing
individual to become aware of the subjective nature of truth—as opposed to the
objective—in order to become a Christian.&nbsp; But it should be noted, Kierkegaard
does not advocate a non-reflective faith.&nbsp; One can and should be reflective and
rational concerning one’s faith.&nbsp; But one must always recognize the process of
reflection is directed in faith toward the subject’s relationship with the
truth.&nbsp; After all, faith is only possible by an existing subject, of which each
human being is, and not an object.&nbsp; As he explains, </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">When the question
of truth is raised in an objective manner, reflection is directed objectively
to the truth, as an object to which the knower is related. Reflection is not
focused upon the relationship, however, but upon the question of whether it is
the truth to which the knower is related.&nbsp; If only the object to which he is
related is the truth, the subject is accounted to be in the truth.&nbsp; When the
question of the truth is raised subjectively, reflection is directed
subjectively to the nature of the individual’s relationship; if only the mode
of this relationship is in the truth, the individual is in the truth even if he
should happen to be thus related to what is not true.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[18]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Contrary to being
a negative and pejorative use of the term “subjective”, and somehow taking away
the concept of truth as belief corresponding to something that is actually the
case, for example the existence of God, Kierkegaard is actually very brave in
his assertion that God is somehow not bound by our simple categories of true
and not true.&nbsp; But in fact, Kierkegaard’s faith in God can be seen as very
secure in that he seems to believe God can overcome the petty distinctions,
errors, and untruths that a poor, pitiful, and existing individual human being
can entertain.&nbsp; I propose that what can be heard in this passage from
Kierkegaard is a firm belief in a God represented by the scripture, “The LORD
does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance,
but the LORD looks at the heart.” <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[19]</span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">For Kierkegaard
then, truth as subjectivity seems to imply a relational state of existence and
not a set of propositions to be believed, which would be objective truth.&nbsp; The
propositions about Christianity, i.e., doctrine, beliefs, historical facts,
etc…, if held at all, are meaningful and valid only for the person who is in a
relationship of passionate inwardness, or subjectivity.&nbsp; The relationship is
with the “objective uncertainty”, which is the historical and propositional—or
objective—“facts” about Christianity, i.e., Christ’s birth, death, and
resurrection.&nbsp; These facts are, at best, an approximation of the truth of
Christianity.&nbsp; For Kierkegaard, religious truth does not spring from
theoretical reasoning.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[20]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
What is more certain is to hold these truths in passionate awareness that one is
holding on to the paradoxical nature of these historical facts about
Christianity.&nbsp; These facts are not Christianity itself, but an approximation of
certain truths about Christ.&nbsp; Kierkegaard explains, “…because an approximation
is the only certainty attainable for historical knowledge—but also an
inadequate basis for an eternal happiness.”<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[21]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Kierkegaard also
has much to say about how one holds on to subjective truth.&nbsp; Passion, it could
be said from reading the <i>Postscript</i>, is synonymous with subjectivity.&nbsp; Therefore,
a loose rendering of what Kierkegaard means by subjective truth could be
“conviction”.&nbsp; Being passionately convinced of the relationship one has with
God, who is all truth, even though God is infinite and man is merely finite.&nbsp;
It could be said that a prime characteristic of subjective truth is its holding
on to this awareness which seems absurd, because of its paradoxical nature, yet
it cannot be grasped any other way.&nbsp; Kierkegaard explains this passionate
inwardness as the necessary stage to becoming a Christian: </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Christianity is
spirit, spirit is inwardness, inwardness is subjectivity, subjectivity is
essentially passion, and in its maximum an infinite, personal, passionate
interest in one’s eternal happiness.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[22]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">As mentioned
above, another characteristic of subjectivity is the notion of paradox.&nbsp; In the
<i>Postscript</i>, subjective truth involves belief in the face of the absurd.&nbsp;
Belief in the absurd comes about if what one holds to be true is a paradox.&nbsp;
Because paradox involves a seeming contradiction, the absurdity of such a thing
is a primary example of holding to a truth subjectively.&nbsp; In fact, there is no
other way one can hold to a truth of this kind.&nbsp; Being that there are two kinds
of truth, one must acknowledge that to hold to the truth of a seemingly logical
contradiction would obviously have to be held subjectively—it could not be held
objectively.&nbsp; For Kierkegaard, the incarnation of Christ is the ultimate
paradox and can only be held to be true in a subjective, or passionate, manner,
i.e., through passionate inwardness.&nbsp; Kierkegaard explains, </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">The absurd
is—that the eternal truth has come into being in time, that God has come into
being, has been born, has grown up, and so forth, precisely like any other
individual human being, quite indistinguishable from other individuals.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[23]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">For Kierkegaard, the
paradoxical marks the boundary and limits of objective and theoretical
thought.&nbsp; With Kant, he endeavors to point out the limits of what reason can
know.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[24]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
And like Kant, he does this in order to make room for faith.&nbsp; The incarnation
is just such a truth that can only be true subjectively.&nbsp; In other words, there
is nothing to point to or observe that would give us a verifying principle to
prove the God-Man, Jesus Christ, was really who He said He was.&nbsp; This truth
must be arrived at by faith.&nbsp; And faith cannot come about except through
passionate, inward awareness of the absurd paradox one is asked to believe.&nbsp;
Therefore, quite simply, a subjective truth is one held personally, with no
recourse to scientific or empirically verifiable data.&nbsp; If one would be honest,
one would see the multitude of beliefs regarding the world and human life that
are held quite regularly in this way.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial"><b>An attempt to justify subjectivity in religious faith</b></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">It has been said that
Kierkegaard believed that in order to become fully human one must become a
Christian.&nbsp; It has also been argued that subjectivity in general does not
necessarily imply irrationality.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[25]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
Again, on the contrary, there seems to be two ways of approaching religious
truth.&nbsp; These were discussed above.&nbsp; Kierkegaard is simply asking for an
authentic and honest appraisal of the human condition.&nbsp; After all, where else
would one start?&nbsp; Once the existential human condition is explored, we come to
see that in order to become fully human (subjective) one must become a
Christian, and vice versa.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Kierkegaard
goes on to explain that to lead an objective life is really to make one’s
existence accidental, or of no real significance or consequence.&nbsp; Kierkegaard
gives us his either/or of life: either an objective existence or a subjective
one.&nbsp; By this he doesn’t mean that each one does not have its place.&nbsp; But one
must choose by which way he will live, especially in regard to one’s eternal
happiness or religious devotion.&nbsp; If one chooses the subjective way, then one
will echo the burning question of Kierkegaard from his journals, </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">“What I really
need is to become clear in my own mind <i>what I must do</i>, not what I must
know--except in so far as a knowing must precede every action.&nbsp; The important
thing is to understand what I am destined for, to perceive what the Deity wants
<i>me</i> to do; the point is to find the truth which is truth <i>for me</i>,
to find <i>that idea for which I am ready to live and die</i>”.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[26]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">To
live subjectively is to live decisively.&nbsp; To be subjectively in the truth
includes being engaged in one’s own existence, and therefore one’s eternal
happiness and state.&nbsp; Kierkegaard explains it this way in the “Truth is
Subjectivity” section in the <i>Postscript</i>: </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">The way of
objective reflection makes the subject accidental, and thereby transforms
existence into something indifferent, something vanishing.&nbsp; Away from the
subject the objective way of reflection leads to the objective truth, and while
the subject and his subjectivity become indifferent, the truth also becomes
indifferent, and this indifference is precisely its objective validity; for all
interest, like all decisiveness, is rooted in subjectivity.&nbsp; The way of
objective reflection leads to abstract thought, to mathematics, to historical
knowledge of different kinds; and always it leads away from the subject, whose
existence or non-existence, and from the objective point of view quite rightly,
becomes infinitely indifferent.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[27]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Notice the
language of movement in the above quoted passage.&nbsp; Kierkegaard believed that to
engage in objective reflection was to move further away from one’s own
humanity.&nbsp; And consequently, further from the truth and God.&nbsp; Above all,
religious truth—truth about one’s own existence, eternal state, and faith in
God—must be held personally, passionately, and subjectively, which are
synonymous terms in regard to Kierkegaard’s view of truth as subjectivity.</font></font></p>



<p><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial"><b>Examples of the subjective nature of Truth in the Scriptures</b></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">There
is much to be said about “Truth” in scripture.&nbsp; I will focus on three passages
that show the subjective nature of truth, as Kierkegaard defines subjectivity.&nbsp;
All of these instances involve Jesus and His claims about Himself and the
claims of others about Him.&nbsp; The first instance involves Pilate’s question at
Jesus’ interrogation —“what is truth?”</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">“You are a king, then!” said Pilate. </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Jesus answered,
“You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and
for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side
of truth listens to me.” &nbsp;“What is truth?” Pilate asked.<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[28]</span></a></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Jesus’
response to Pilate’s observation, perhaps mockingly, that Jesus was a king can
be seen as pointing directly at Jesus as the truth.&nbsp; In order to be right, or
truthful, one had to be related to Jesus, since He alone was sent into the
world to testify about the truth, which resides in God the Father alone.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Again, Jesus replies to
His disciples that He alone is the way to the Father.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Jesus answered,
“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except
through me. <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[29]</span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">The question was
“show us the way to where you are going”.&nbsp; The answer Jesus gave was that there
is no objectively verifiable criterion for discerning the way to the Father.&nbsp;
Once again Jesus pointed the disciples to Himself.&nbsp; Jesus Himself is the way.&nbsp;
Also, Jesus added that He was the truth.&nbsp; Volumes could be written on things
that Jesus did not say, but yet are sometimes attributed to Him.&nbsp; Jesus did not
say He <i>had</i> the truth or <i>knew</i> the truth, but that He <i>was</i> in
fact the truth.&nbsp; To know Jesus is to know the truth of God.&nbsp; And since
objectively verifiable and empirical data about Jesus as the Son of God does
not exist for us as modern man, or at least at best is an historical
approximation, then any truth at all about Jesus as the way the truth and the
life must come through subjective means.&nbsp; This is Kierkegaard’s main point
about truth as subjectivity.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Again Jesus told
His disciples, &nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">“If you hold to
my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free.” <a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">[30]</span></a></font></font></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">Kierkegaard
was adamant, echoing the Greeks, that to know the truth was to do the truth.&nbsp; I
believe that Kierkegaard would agree with the statement that in the obedience
to Christ lies the disciple’s relation with the truth, which is Christ Himself.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial"><b>Summary</b></font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">While there are some
problematic points that Kierkegaard seems to assert in the <i>Postscript</i>
concerning the nature of subjective truth, he also raises many strong points
that are helpful in understanding what it means to be a Christian within an
existential framework.&nbsp; His emphasis on decision, passion, faith, and personal
responsibility are challenges to the Christian of this age, as it was to his
own.&nbsp; His clarion call to hold passionately the individual’s relationship to
God is a much needed corrective to the sometimes shallow and indifferent mood
of North American Christianity.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2" face="arial">A sympathetic reading
of Kierkegaard raises the awareness of being passionate, inward, personally
concerned, and decisive when it comes to one’s eternal happiness.&nbsp; It seems to
me that if one is to take seriously the question of one’s own existence in the
current world-context, one must grapple with Kierkegaard’s approach to
religious truth as a state of subjectivity.&nbsp; If an object is a finished entity,
and to “objectify” is to remove the object under consideration from affecting
one as a subject, and thereby having power over the object in question, then it
seems to me that one could never objectively believe in God at all.&nbsp; The kind
of God that would allow Himself to be known objectively would be no God at
all.&nbsp; On the contrary, He would be a god that is nothing more than a projection
of man’s own egomaniacal need to overcome and an expression of pride, instead
of submission to what, or Whom, man can never fully comprehend.&nbsp; Objective
truth rationalizes, systematizes, completes, and arrives at certain knowledge,
therefore; God cannot not be known entirely through objective means.&nbsp; To be
subjective implies the process of discovering God continues infinitely.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is to this eternal discovery we are called.&nbsp; Could it be that we
were created to enjoy an eternal “leaping” into the discovery of God Himself?&nbsp;
Perhaps our existence here on earth is only meant to represent the unending
discovery of the infinite God through the search and process of becoming.&nbsp;
Maybe the best anyone can claim at the end of one’s life is to echo the words
of Kierkegaard, “I was always only becoming a Christian.”<a href="johnson-truth.shtml#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial;">[31]</span></span></span></a></font></font></p>
