Since the Enlightenment, many  influential philosophers such as Karl Marx and
Michel Foucault
    have claimed that popular culture serves to enforce and justify the prevailing
    political
    ideology and power structure. Popular culture functions silently
    and insidiously to keep ordinary people ignorant of their true situation.

    These philosophers argue that ordinary beliefs about religion and ethics,
    and ordinary social institutions
    such as the media, the arts, the health care system
    (especially the mental health establishment), the courts and prisons,
    the educational system, etc. simply express, perpetuate, and justify current
    power relationships. <p class=MsoNormal><p class=MsoNormal>
    According to these philosophers, ordinary people's
     beliefs are those that serve
    the interests of the dominant class.  Society's institutions quietly benefit and
    reproduce that power structure. For example, on this view, the
    function of religion and schools is to produce docile citizens who will work hard
    and not
    complain. The function of universities is create
    a mandarin class of educated middle managers to carry out the day-to-day
    administration of
    powerful people's affairs. The mental health establishment decides who is
    "normal"
    and who is "deviant" or "crazy"; it can lock up the "crazy" people and thereby
    neutralize and dispose of anyone who criticizes the current regime. (This tactic
    was widely used
    in the former Soviet Union, and is described memorably in the novels of Alexandr
    Solzhenitzyn.)
    The judicial system does an analogous job: it decides what constitutes crime
    and inflicts
    what it considers appropriate punishment. The function of newspapers and
    television is
    to make the powerful invisible, or to report
    only what powerful people want ordinary people to hear, or to provide
    mindless entertainments and, most importantly,
    advertisements to distract ordinary people from their real wants and needs.
    <p class=MsoNormal>

   "Consumer culture" refers to culture characterized by
   omnipresent advertising and the penetration of the techniques of advertising into
   all realms
   of human life, including our self-images and identities.
   Consumer culture is the culture of first world nations today, and especially of
   America
   and Japan.

   <p class=MsoNormal>
Critiques of consumer culture, because of
their subversive nature, often
   appear innocuous or merely ironic; for
   example, see the article <a href=
   "http://www.snpp.com/other/papers/st.paper.html">The
   Simpsons as a Critique of Consumer Culture</a>. </font></span><span style=

<h3><a name="Marx"><B>II. MARX/ENGELS: Culture as Superstructure</a></b></h3>
  <p class=MsoNormal>

Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) was Karl
    Marx’s longtime friend and collaborator. They were co-authors of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Communist Manifesto</i>. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Marx and Engels were very influenced by
    G. W. F. Hegel’s notion of the dialectic of history. Hegel (1770-1831) believed
    that the entire course of history is the expression of what he called “the
    Absolute.” The Absolute unfolds by a dialectical process: every state of affairs
    (thesis) gives rise to its opposite (antithesis), and then a synthesis of
    the two is formed, which becomes the new thesis, and the process starts all
    over again. Hegel thought the Absolute revealed itself as “objective spirit”
    in social organizations, in particular in the family, civil society, and the
    nation-state. For Hegel, the nation-state is the most important of these three,
    and the culmination of the historical dialectic. In a nation-state, a person
    can achieve the highest level of self-realization, because his interests <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>qua</i> human and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>qua</i> citizen are merged in a new synthesis. A person is thus most free
    in a nation-state, in the sense of having the most opportunities for realizing
    his full potential. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Marx and Engels, as metaphysical materialists,
    got rid of Hegel’s “Absolute” (too mysterious, spiritual, and unscientific),
    but kept the notion of dialectic (thesis/antithesis/synthesis); hence their
    theory is often called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal
    '>dialectical materialism</i>.
    </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>In their “dialectic of history,” every
    major historical political/economic arrangement (pre-history, ancient empires,
    feudalism, capitalism) is a thesis that “contains the seeds of its own
    destruction”
    (its antithesis), and so is bound to be replaced by a further synthesis. The
    thesis and antithesis are the opposing economic classes (e.g., lords vs serfs,
    capitalists vs proletarians); the dialectic of history thus manifests itself
    in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>class struggle</i>. The final synthesis
    is pure communism, which, according to Marx and Engels, will inevitably replace
    capitalism.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The fundamental principle of Marx and
    Engels’ thought is thus that economic conditions determine all social
    arrangements,
    human relationships, thought, and values. In Marxist terminology, the economic
    “substructure” determines the cultural “superstructure.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>But Marxists do not use the word “economics”
    in the sense of the social science you can study at WVC. In fact Marxists
    are skeptical about the “science” of economics. They find two notions of that
    “science” particularly absurd: </p>
    <OL>
    <LI>
The so-called “free market”<p class=MsoNormal>
<LI>
 The so-called “law” of supply and demand<p class=MsoNormal>
 </OL>
 <p class=MsoNormal>
Marxists say these notions, masquerading
    as “science,” are simply myths that serve the interests of capitalism. Obviously
    (to Marxists) the capitalists control both the market (i.e., no way is it
    free), and also both supply and demand (i.e., there is no neutral “law” of
    supply and demand). Capitalists clearly control supply; but they also control
    demand by their control of media, which they use to manipulate people’s
    perceptions
    of their “needs.” That is, capitalists make people think they need things
    that they really don’t need. Then, having created “demand,” capitalists can
    raise prices (leaving workers’ wages the same), and make more and more profits.
    Thus, says Marx, the condition of the worker inevitably gets worse and worse.
    The more he produces, the less he can buy.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Marx says this situation is inherently
    unstable, because workers will inevitably get more and more miserable, and
    the economic and social gap between workers and capitalists will grow wider
    and wider. The workers will eventually revolt and seize ownership of the means
    of production. This is why Marx says capitalism “contains the seeds of its
    own destruction.” </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Contemporary Marxists, such as Marcuse,
    are less optimistic about the inevitability of revolution (see next section
    on alienation), because they see workers in advanced capitalism as victims
    of more sophisticated and all-pervasive manipulation than Marx or Engels ever
    dreamed possible. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Because economic conditions determine
    all social arrangements, Marxists say there is an intimate connection between
    ethics and ideology. As Engels says, “All former moral theories are the product,
    in the last analysis, of the economic stage which society had reached at that
    particular epoch. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms,
    morality was always a class morality; it has either justified the domination
    and interests of the ruling class, or, as soon as the oppressed class has
    become powerful enough, it has represented the revolt against this domination
    and the future interests of the oppressed.” (from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Anti-Dühring</i>, as cited by Strull and Strull,
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ethics in Perspective</i>, 147) </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>In the essay “Morality as Class Interest”
    from his 1878 work <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Anti-Dühring</i>,
    Engels describes the historical development of the concept that all persons
    have equal human rights. The concept develops in history because of economic
    conditions. According to Engels, history shows the progressive expansion of
    the concept, i.e., economic conditions make it inevitable that more and more
    people are thought “equal.” There are natural laws of history operating here:
    political and social equality is tied to economic power, the more communal
    ownership of the means of production, the more equality. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>In primitive communal societies, where
    people had little individual wealth or property to lose, there was equality
    among all men, though women, slaves, and strangers were excluded. That is
    to say, communal ownership goes with a relatively broad notion of equality.
    In Greco-Roman times, when wealth had become concentrated in the hands of
    some men, the concept of equality was correspondingly diminished; “it would
    have seemed ... idiotic to the ancients that Greeks and barbarians, freemen
    and slaves, citizens and dependents, Roman citizens and Roman subjects ...
    should have a claim to equal political status.” (as cited by Strull and Strull,
    148) Later in the development of the Roman Empire, the concept of Roman
    citizenship
    was broadened because more people became involved in trade and commerce,
    but
    the gap between freemen and slaves (and men and women) remained.
    </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The feudal Middle Ages saw the rise of
    nation-states and the beginnings of the bourgeoisie. Explorations of the New
    World and increased trade contributed to the economic ascendency of the
    bourgeoisie,
    though the state and Church organization remained feudal (Popes and kings).
    The bourgeoisie, in order to sell their goods to the most customers with
    maximum
    profit, needed to be able to trade freely and also needed international trading
    laws. Thus, economic conditions forced the issue of their political equality.
    The bourgeoisie acquired political equality because economic conditions had
    changed. It was a struggle, since the Church and government had to give up
    some of their power; but it had to happen. Meanwhile, the notion of equality
    found its way into the general thought of the times, into the writings of
    philosophers and political theorists. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>When manufacturing replaced handicraft,
    the bourgeoisie also needed to be able to make contracts with workers. The
    workers traded their labor for wages. So the workers, too, acquired a certain
    amount of political power; in order to make a contract with a bourgeois, a
    worker was in a sense his equal. The granting of political power to workers
    was happening at the time Marx and Engels were writing. The notions of natural,
    built-in “human rights” and the natural political equality of all men had
    become widely popular — indeed, were almost taken for granted. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>This illustrates the general Marxist claim
    that ethical values simply mirror economic realities. “The idea of equality,
    therefore, both in its bourgeois and proletarian form, is itself a historical
    product, the creation of which required definite historical conditions which
    in turn themselves presuppose a long previous historical development. It is
    therefore anything but an eternal truth.”(as cited by Strull and Strull,151)
    </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>And the dialectic of history goes on.
    The bourgeoisie’s demands for political equality, and subsequent achievement
    of this goal, sow the seeds of the destruction of the bourgeoisie itself!
    The bourgeoisie is the thesis, the proletariat its antithesis. You can’t have
    a bourgeois (upper) class without provoking a negative reaction from the
    proletarian
    class. The proletarian demand for equality with the bourgeoisie is particularly
    ironic, because the bourgeoisie provided the proletariat with the rhetoric
    and argument for their position! But now the proletariat argues, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>using bourgeois egalitarian reasoning</i>,
    for a complete abolition of classes! </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>“True” ethics — what Engels calls “a
really
    human morality” — has never happened; all morality so far has been “class
    morality,” the morality of the dominant or ascendent class. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>It is no accident that at any period of
    history, there appear to be many competing moral codes. This is because the
    dialectic of history moves slowly, like a glacier, and carries with it the
    residues of previous periods. Engels illustrates this by pointing out how
    Christian-feudal morality (the oldest) coexists with bourgeois morality
    (historically
    current) and proletarian morality (the wave of the future).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>For example, because remnants of older
    moralities still coexist with newer ones, current Western society is in conflict
    over the role of women. Some people, such as conservative fundamentalists,
    think women should be subservient to men in all matters. This view exemplifies
    the oldest remnant, the Christian-feudal view. On this view, women are seen
    as just as sinful, if not more sinful, than men. They are the “weaker vessel”
    — weaker in intelligence, and morality as well as in strength, needing the
    guidance and moral leadership of men. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>If the Christian-feudal view is the thesis,
    its antithesis is the bourgeois view of women, common in the upper classes
    of Europe in the 19th century, and, of course, still very much alive. On the
    bourgeois view, women are regarded as morally superior to men; they are the
    guardians of the home and hearth, moral models and moral educators. The home
    is thought to be the man’s “refuge” from the ugly, competitive, brutal world
    of the marketplace; and woman’s job is to make the home as pleasant and
    orderly
    and morally upright as possible for the husband and children. The woman is
    the “angel of the hearth.” On the bourgeois view, women have authority on
    matters pertaining to home and child-rearing, although they do not control
    the purse-strings. So while the wife is idealized for her innate moral superiority,
    she is still treated as a child or a servant when it comes to matters outside
    the home. On the bourgeois view, “fallen” or “forward” women are doubly evil;
    they are both immoral and unnatural. Tolstoy’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Anna Karenina</i> and Flaubert’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>
Madame
    Bovary</i> exemplify the fate of “fallen” bourgeois women of the period.
    </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the most “advanced” view of
women’s
    role — since it is the synthesis of the previous ones — is that of the proletariat.
    For proletarians (workers), there are hardly any sex-specific roles at all.
    Sex is not necessarily a criterion of eligibility for, or exclusion from,
    any job. You can see this if you just look at proletarian women, Engels says.
    They do pretty much everything men do. Unlike the bourgeoisie, proletarians
    neither condemn women, nor put them on a pedestal. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Proletarian marriage, according to Engels,
    is more of a true partnership than any previously possible. But it isn’t the
    last word; it is still a relation of oppression based on mutual economic need
    rather than authentically chosen, truly human ties. Marriage itself is to
    be superseded in the utopia of pure communism. </p>

   <U>Marx’s Conception of the Good

  <p class=MsoNormal>
  Like Aristotle, Marx begins his analysis
    of the good life by noting what is distinctive about humans — the characteristics
    that make humans different from animals. Marx notes the obvious facts that
<p class=MsoNormal>

<LI class=MsoNormal>
Humans
    can think about more than animals (because of language). In fact, humans can
    think about the whole world. <p class=MsoNormal>

Animals deal primarily in particulars.
    They manipulate the world — in Marx’s terminology, they “produce” — but their
    productions are limited. They feed and hunt and build shelter only to meet
    their immediate needs. Their production is repetitive and stereotyped; that
    is, given a particular environment, the same species always produces the same
    things, again and again. That is, the species determines the mode of productive
    life (the being) of animals, in accordance with laws of genetics and
    ethology.<p class=MsoNormal>



Humans are different. They constitute
    a species, but a species of a very different type. Their species-being — their
    productive life, or manipulation of the world — is unique, in the following
    ways:<p class=MsoNormal>

Species-being is the characteristic
productive
    life of a species. The foregoing considerations establish that the species-being
    of humans is unique. Both theoretically and practically, the species-being
    (characteristic productive life) of humans is unlimited and universal. The
    productive life of a human living in accordance with human species-being will
    thus be physically and psychologically <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

A human life lived in accordance with
    human species-being (a truly human life), therefore, will have the following

A truly human life is a life of self-initiated,
    self-directed activity (production) in the world, according to standards of

    “natural”; such a life allows for the full expression of human
    species-being.</span><p class=MsoNormal></UL>
    <p class=MsoNormal>

As we have seen above, Marx and Engels
    say that all human flourishing and culture depends on economic conditions.
    They also argue that truly human living — the ideal human life in accordance
    with species-being — has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> been
    possible, because the right economic conditions have never existed. Only pure
    communism will provide such conditions. To understand why humans cannot live
    truly human lives under capitalism, we need to explore Marx’s notion of
    “alienated
    labor.”</span></p>

 <u>Alienation
    from Nature</u><p class=MsoNormal>
The worker is alienated from nature
(anything
    outside self) in the following ways:</p>

<UL>
<li class=MsoNormal>
The
    worker must assist the capitalist in ecologically disastrous practices, which
    destroy nature, his “inorganic body.”</p>
<li class=MsoNormal>The
    worker comes to hate the very objects he creates (the product of his
    labor).</p>

<li class=MsoNormal>The
    worker comes to view nature (his inorganic body) pure instrumentally. That
    is, the worker worries only about how nature can be used.</p>
</UL>

<p class=MsoNormal>
All these results are directly counter
    to true human species being.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><u>Alienation
    from the Body</u></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
The worker is alienated from his body
    since all his physical assets — strength, agility, quickness, etc. — are harnessed
    by the capitalist for the capitalist’s benefit. The worker’s own body thus
    contributes directly to the perpetuation of the system that exploits him or
    her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
In addition, the worker’s body is harmed
    by dangerous and/or unhealthy working conditions, stress, etc.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><u>Alienation
    from Fully Human Life</span></u><p class=MsoNormal>
Workers want to produce in a fully human
    way because such production is the realization of their species-being, their
    heart’s desire, the realization of true human nature. But according to Marx,
    under capitalism they can produce only in a limited, animal way. In what ways
    are workers alienated from a full humanly productive life? </span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
First, workers cannot direct their own
    production. The capitalist dictates what they produce. The worker’s work life
    is thus a kind of animal servitude; he “feels himself to be freely active
    only in his animal functions —<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>eating,
    drinking, and procreating, or at most also in his dwelling and in personal
    adornment — while in his human functions
    he is reduced to an animal. The animal becomes human and the human becomes
    animal.”</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
Thus, work, which in true human species-
being
    is a joy and an end in itself, is merely a means to the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>animal</i> end of self-preservation. Workers
    want to produce. It’s human nature (human species-being) to want to be
    productive
    in a fully human way. But the workplace squelches this desire, and workers
    find no satisfaction in their jobs; in fact, they can find satisfaction only
    in less-than-human enterprises. “The culmination of this enslavement is that
    [the worker] can only maintain himself as a physical subject so far as he
    is a worker.” The worker must work in order to live; but the life she lives
    is mainly the life of work, which she hates. In other words, the worker is
    forced to work against herself. She knows this, and it makes her crazy, because
    she knows there is no alternative.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
Because the worker comes to hate the
very
    objects she creates, and because these objects represent the expenditure of
    her physical and psychological resources (her very self), the worker comes
    to hate herself through those objects. The products of her labor are constant
    reminders that her life is fundamentally (and hopelessly) flawed. The work
    is a constant source of psychological stress: the work itself is boring and
    mind-deadening; the worker cannot complain or show her true creative self
    on the job (and if she does, her ideas will be appropriated by the capitalist);
    and the worker has no job security. The characteristic feature of these
    psychological
    difficulties is the psychological double-bind: the worker is forced to make
    choices among options, none of which he really wants (because none fulfill
    his species-being). Whatever you choose, you lose.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
Twentieth-century Marxists, particularly
    Shulamith Firestone, make an interesting comparison between the institution
    of the job and the institution of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>school</i> under capitalism. The same sort of perversion of natural ends
    occurs both at work and at school; indeed, the renunciations learned at school
    prepare the working-class child for life as a worker. Children by nature want
    to learn and love to learn; learning is the realization of their full child
    nature, their species-being. However, the real function of the school under
    capitalism is to squelch the natural desire to learn (just as the job squelches
    the natural desire to work). The important lessons for children in schools
    are lessons in how to be a good worker: be on time, be there every day, obey
    orders, don’t make trouble, don’t ask too many questions, get used to boredom.
    The social institution most like school is prison; and this is no accident.
    After a few weeks, children who originally came to school filled with the
    desire to learn are happiest when they are released from school. Their desire
    to learn goes unsatisfied.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>

Even when workers are relatively well-off,
    e.g., in advanced capitalist societies like contemporary America, they
    nevertheless
    become alienated from themselves in other, more subtle ways. They suffer from
    "affluenza."
    For example,
    they come to view <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>themselves</i> as
    they are viewed by capitalism — as objects. Contemporary capitalist consumer
    culture offers the consolation of money and possessions. But consumer culture
    is designed to stop us from thinking about who we really are, and what we
    really want. In consumer culture, you express yourself intelligibly only through
    your consumption, through your purchases; your identity is tied up in the
    products you buy; your very self is merely another “package” on display. (No
    wonder students resist the self-promotion required to obtain a “real” job;
    it is nothing but “grooming for the camera,” which they understand.) Not
    excellence,
    but the appearance of excellence counts. Not honesty and diligence, but the
    show. (It’s always show time.) The goal of life is to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>become</i> an image, a shadow self — to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>be seen </i>a certain way, but never to see.
    But that goal is perverse: a life of passivity, consuming prepackaged images
    and being consumed by them. Only the image-makers profit; but more
    importantly,
    we lose sight of our active, whole-hearted, authentic, best selves.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
But that’s not the only problem with
advanced
    capitalism and its consumer culture. Capitalism, via consumer culture, swallows
    up its potential enemies — the underclass, and non-mainstream cultures.
    Capitalism
    exploits cultural differences for profit, and by doing so, tends to dilute,
    neutralize, and negate non-mainstream cultures. Capitalist consumer culture
    cares about profit; it cares about creating and maintaining markets for “new”
    products, so that people will feel dissatisfied with their current stuff,
    throw it out, and buy new stuff. Capitalism doesn’t care about race or ethnicity
    or gender or sexual preference; in fact, it exploits both the attractive and
    unattractive aspects of underclass or minority culture for novelty in the
    marketplace. It feeds on minority and underclass culture, glamorizing it,
    ingesting its exotic flavors, dissolving all its potentially threatening aspects.
    As a matter of standard practice, it co-opts and usurps the exotic, marginal,
    and even threatening aspects of minority culture in order to make profit;
    the exotic becomes the “new,” i.e., new products, new fashions, new media
    idols. </span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
Most significant is that capitalism can
    do all this while enlisting the voluntary cooperation of the very cultures
    being exploited. Inasmuch as capitalism influences style and corrupts desire,
    the poor, desiring what capitalism has to offer, often offer themselves up
    to be consumed. These observations are nothing new to sociologists or Marxists;
    Marxists call the process “cultural imperialism.” Herbert Marcuse’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>One-Dimensional Man</i> is the classic recent
    expression of this line of analysis.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
What is new is the unprecedented
influence
    of professional image-makers on popular culture. Contemporary consumer culture
    features the systematic construction of images of all kinds; “advertising”
    or “commercials” are only a small part of the package. Practically all of
    mainstream television is advertising in one form or another: what the characters
    wear, eat, and drive, as well as how their houses are furnished, are all carefully
    chosen, and certainly send as many messages as what the characters
    say.</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"

    their money in ways guaranteed to make profit for someone else, thus
    impoverishing
    themselves and reinforcing the gap between the economic classes. Capitalism,
    meanwhile, doesn’t have to worry that Ice T will say anything really radical
    (like “Let’s get rid of consumer culture”), because Ice T is becoming rich
    within the system. Madonna plays at being a “sexually liberated woman”; she
    co-opts the language of the women’s movement and gay liberation to make
    money
    for herself and for Time-Warner (the giant communications conglomerate to
    whom she is under contract for movies, CDs, and books). At the same time she
    reinforces the traditional fantasy of woman as sex object, thus making it
    more difficult in the long run for women, especially older women, to be heard.
    Benetton ads show homosexual AIDS victims dying in the arms of their parents.
    The scandalous music of 25 years ago (the Doors’ “Light My Fire,” the Beatles
    “Revolution”) now sells cars. Malcolm X becomes a Hollywood icon. Coca-Cola
    co-opts the religious language of universal brotherhood and sisterhood (people
    of all ages, colors, and costumes holding hands, walking forward through the
    meadow into the future together sharing Cokes) while making huge profits from
    the sale of sugared water that rots the teeth of children in countries where
    there is no dental care. And no one is forcing them to buy Coke.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
As minority cultures of all kinds are
    mainstreamed, the majority culture itself changes, which in turn fertilizes
    changes in minority tastes and buying habits. Marketing strategies are narrowed
    to maximize profits, which often means maintaining and perpetuating economic
    class differences, now <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chosen</i> more
    or less voluntarily by the economically already-oppressed, who willingly fork
    over their hard-earned money for Nikes and Coke and Madonna CDs. No really

    the more I emphasize my difference, the more my difference is liable to be
    either marginalized or co-opted for profit. And the more my difference is
    exploited for profit — the more fashionable it becomes to be “different” —
    the more culturally alike we all become. Class distinctions, however, are

Alienation from Others</u><p class=MsoNormal>

<p class=MsoNormal>
Workers comes to view other workers as
    they themselves are viewed by the capitalist — as objects to be manipulated.
    Other workers’ feelings — their interior lives — do not count. When workers
    see other workers as objects, capitalism wins and the status quo is preserved,
    because as long as workers do not identify with each other, they do not trust
    one another and are incapable of joining together. Workers see other workers
    simply as competitors for the meager rewards they are offered. It’s everyone
    for him/herself. Thus, workers do not join together to fight the real
    enemy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
In addition, much psychic and social
damage
    is done. Workers feel rootless, without significant ties to their communities.
    Safety and civility deteriorate.<p class=MsoNormal>
<p class=MsoNormal>
<U>Intellectual
    Alienation</u><p class=MsoNormal>

<p class=MsoNormal>
Alienation also takes place in the realm
    of the intellect. The worker is constantly faced with what Marx calls <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contradictions</i>. A contradiction in the
    Marxist sense is not exactly the same as a logical contradiction, though it
    is related. In Marxist terminology, a contradiction is a notion that is constantly
    promulgated by the ruling class, but is clearly false (if you let yourself
    think about it). Contradictions are fictions that serve the interests of the
    ruling class. The ruling class needs to continually propagandize contradictions,
    so workers don’t think to question them.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>

Examples of contradictions are: “Anyone
    who works hard and perseveres can make as much money as Rockefeller,”
    “Anyone
    can be successful if they really want to,” etc. If workers believe these things,
    then they blame themselves (not capitalism) if they fail to become rich. It
    is clearly very advantageous to capitalists that workers believe these sorts
    of things, then. </span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
Another Marxist contradiction: “This is
    the way to live: you meet the right person, fall in love, get married, have
    children, and live happily ever after.” This message, which is more or less
    explicit in much religious teaching and in media, serves the interests of
    capitalism because under capitalism, the family is the unit of consumption
    of “big-ticket” items, such as houses, cars, TVs, furniture, appliances, etc.
    It’s no accident that capitalist systems, aided by religion, foster “family
    values.”</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
These notions are so central to our
consciousness
    that we never think to question them, even if they are entirely foreign to
    our experience of the world. A typical worker doesn’t know a single person
    who has ever made as much money as Rockefeller, or know anybody whose
    family
    life meets the ideal. Yet we maintain these beliefs, consistently denying
    our own experience; and we blame ourselves if we fall short of these ideals.
    We never think to question the beliefs themselves; or if we do, people don’t
    understand what we’re saying.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
Marx’s notion of “contradiction” is
analogous
    to the “conspiracy of silence” characteristic of dysfunctional families. The
    child knows Daddy is drunk, but must say “Everything is fine.” The child learns,
    in any case, that no one wants to hear what he has to say. He may even begin
    to wonder if he is seeing things correctly. Since his perceptions are never
    affirmed, he ends up not trusting his own mind —<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in a kind of psychic “dis-integration.” He
    becomes intellectually dulled. Marx says the same thing happens to workers
    under capitalism; constantly bombarded with contradictions (and, according
    to 20th-century Marxists, advertising), they find it difficult to think straight.
    The effect in both cases is the same: people become intellectually dulled,
    depressed, bored, cynical, and live less-than-human lives.</span></p>

      and other primarily visual media convey messages far more quickly and
      efficiently
      than the printed word; human brains process visual information far more
      quickly than written symbols. Mere words, one person’s opinion simply stated
      or written, no matter how clearly or eloquently, cannot compete with media.
      Many students seem to know this in their bones. Thus many of our students,
      raised on images, seem to have given up on words; when teachers try to elicit
      words from them, in speeches or in essays, many students are not merely
      tongue-tied — they are incoherent. </p>

      and writers have a carefully constructed veneer of “objectivity” about
      “serious”
      news — free-floating, without context, and unengaged — that is, by design,
      utterly boring. News stories all sound the same because they’re supposed
      to.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal
      '> Murphy Brown</i> is a good illustration
      of this. The stories on the fictional news program <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>FYI</i> are all summarized in sound bites:
      Murphy’s “corrupt Aministration official scandal” story, Frank’s “pollution
      story,” Corkie’s “Mary Kay Cosmetics story.” We don’t need to hear the stories
      themselves because we already know them. In order to keep the audience from
      changing channels (and thus miss the commercials), news programs must focus
      a disproportionate amount of attention on “human interest” stories, celebrities,
      and other trivialities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
