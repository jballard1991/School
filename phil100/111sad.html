Introduction by Laura Del Col: In 1832 Michael Sadler secured a parliamentary investigation of conditions
in the textile 
factories and he sat as chairman on the committee. The evidence
printed here is taken from the large body published in the committee's report
and is representative rather than exceptional. It will be observed that the
questions are frequently leading; this reflects Sadler's knowledge of the sort
of information that the committee were to hear and his purpose of bringing it
out. This report stands out as one of three great reports on the life of the
industrial class--the two others being that of the Ashley Commission on the
mines and Chadwick's report on sanitary problems. The immediate effect of the
investigation and the report was the passage of the Act of 1833 limiting hours
of employment for women and children.

Evidence Given Before the Sadler Committee<p>


Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined.<p>

You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty
comfortable upon your present wages?<BR>
--I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at
some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
<P>
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?<BR>
--No, it will not keep it as it should do.<P>
When they got 6s. or 7s. when they were pieceners, if they reduced the hours of
labor, would they not get less?<BR>
--They would get a halfpenny a day less, but I would rather have less wages and
less work.<P>
Do you receive any parish assistance?<BR>--No.<P>Why do you allow your children
to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or
over-worked?<BR>--Necessity compels a man that has children to let them
work.<P> Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under
the present system, if it was not from necessity?<BR>--No.<P>Supposing there
was a law passed to limit the hours of labour to eight hours a day, or
something of that sort, of course you are aware that a manufacturer could not
afford to pay them the same wages?<BR>--No, I do not suppose that they would,
but at the same time I would rather have it, and I believe that it would bring
me into employ; and if I lost 5d. a day from my children's work, and I got
half-a-crown myself, it would be better.<P>How would it get you into
employ?<BR>--By finding more employment at the machines, and work being more
regularly spread abroad, and divided amongst the people at large. One man is
now regularly turned off into the street, whilst another man is running day and
night.<P>You mean to say, that if the manufacturers were to limit the hours of
labour, they would employ more people?<BR>--Yes.

Mr. Matthew Crabtree, called in; and Examined.<p>
What age are you?<BR>--Twenty-two.<P>What is your occupation?<BR>--A blanket
manufacturer.<P>Have you ever been employed in a factory?<BR>--Yes.<P>At what
age did you first go to work in one?<BR>--Eight.<P>How long did you continue in
that occupation?<BR>--Four years.<P>Will you state the hours of labour at the
period when you first went to the factory, in ordinary times?<BR>--From 6 in
the morning to 8 at night.<P>Fourteen hours?<BR>--Yes.<P>With what intervals
for refreshment and rest?<BR>--An hour at noon.<P>When trade was brisk what
were your hours?<BR>--From 5 in the morning to 9 in the evening.<P>Sixteen
hours?<BR>--Yes.<P>With what intervals at dinner?<BR>--An hour.<P>How far did
you live from the mill?<BR>--About two miles.<P>Was there any time allowed for
you to get your breakfast in the mill?<BR>--No.<P>Did you take it before you
left your home?<BR>--Generally.<P>During those long hours of labour could you
be punctual; how did you awake?<BR>--I seldom did awake spontaneously; I was
most generally awoke or lifted out of bed, sometimes asleep, by my
parents.<P>Were you always in time?<BR>--No.<P>What was the consequence if you
had been too late?<BR>--I was most commonly beaten.<P>Severely?<BR>--Very
severely, I thought.<P>In those mills is chastisement towards the latter part
of the day going on perpetually?<BR>--Perpetually.<P>So that you can hardly be
in a mill without hearing constant crying?<BR>--Never an hour, I believe.<P>Do
you think that if the overlooker were naturally a humane person it would still
be found necessary for him to beat the children, in order to keep up their
attention and vigilance at the termination of those extraordinary days of
labour?<BR>--Yes; the machine turns off a regular quantity of cardings, and of
course, they must keep as regularly to their work the whole of the day; they
must keep with the machine, and therefore however humane the slubber may be, as
he must keep up with the machine or be found fault with, he spurs the children
to keep up also by various means but that which he commonly resorts to is to
strap them when they become drowsy.<P>At the time when you were beaten for not
keeping up with your work, were you anxious to have done it if you possibly
could?<BR>--Yes; the dread of being beaten if we could not keep up with our
work was a sufficient impulse to keep us to it if we could.<P>When you got home
at night after this labour, did you feel much fatigued?<BR>--Very much
so.<P>Had you any time to be with your parents, and to receive instruction from
them?<BR>--No.<P>What did you do?<BR>--All that we did when we got home was to
get the little bit of supper that was provided for us and go to bed
immediately. If the supper had not been ready directly, we should have gone to
sleep while it was preparing.<P>Did you not, as a child, feel it a very
grievous hardship to be roused so soon in the morning?<BR>--I did.<P>Were the
rest of the children similarly circumstanced?<BR>--Yes, all of them; but they
were not all of them so far from their work as I was.<P>And if you had been too
late you were under the apprehension of being cruelly beaten?<BR>--I generally
was beaten when I happened to be too late; and when I got up in the morning the
apprehension of that was so great, that I used to run, and cry all the way as I
went to the mill.

Mr. John Hall, called in; and Examined.<p>
Will
you describe to the Committee the position in which the children stand to piece
in a worsted mill, as it may serve to explain the number and severity of those
cases of distortion which occur?<BR>--At the top to the spindle there is a fly
goes across, and the child takes hold of the fly by the ball of his left hand,
and he throws the left shoulder up and the right knee inward; he has the thread
to get with the right hand, and he has to stoop his head down to see what he is
doing; they throw the right knee inward in that way, and all the children I
have seen, that bend in the right knee. I knew a family, the whole of whom were
bent outwards as a family complaint, and one of those boys was sent to a
worsted-mill, and first he became straight in his right knee, and then he
became crooked in it the other way.

Elizabeth Bentley, called in; and
Examined.<p>
What age are you?<BR>--Twenty-three.<P>Where do you
live?<BR>--At Leeds.<P>What time did you begin to work at a factory?<BR>--When
I was six years old.<P>At whose factory did you work?<BR>--Mr. Busk's.<P>What
kind of mill is it?<BR>--Flax-mill.<P>What was your business in that
mill?<BR>--I was a little doffer.<P>What were your hours of labour in that
mill?<BR>--From 5 in the morning till 9 at night, when they were
thronged.<P>For how long a time together have you worked that excessive length
of time?<BR>--For about half a year.<P>What were your usual hours when you were
not so thronged?<BR>--From 6 in the morning till 7 at night.<P>What time was
allowed for your meals?<BR>--Forty minutes at noon.<P>Had you any time to get
your breakfast or drinking?<BR>--No, we got it as we could.<P>And when your
work was bad, you had hardly any time to eat it at all?<BR>--No; we were
obliged to leave it or take it home, and when we did not take it, the
overlooker took it, and gave it to his pigs.<P>Do you consider doffing a
laborious employment?<BR>--Yes.<P>Explain what it is you had to do?<BR>--When
the frames are full, they have to stop the frames, and take the flyers off, and
take the full bobbins off, and carry them to the roller; and then put empty
ones on, and set the frame going again.<P>Does that keep you constantly on your
feet?<BR>--Yes, there are so many frames, and they run so quick.<P>Your labour
is very excessive?<BR>--Yes; you have not time for any thing.<P>Suppose you
flagged a little, or were too late, what would they do?<BR>--Strap us.<P>Are
they in the habit of strapping those who are last in
doffing?<BR>--Yes.<P>Constantly?<BR>--Yes.<P>Girls as well as
boys?<BR>--Yes.<P>Have you ever been
strapped?<BR>--Yes.<P>Severely?<BR>--Yes.<P>Could you eat your food well in
that factory?<BR>--No, indeed I had not much to eat, and the little I had I
could not eat it, my appetite was so poor, and being covered with dust; and it
was no use to take it home, I could not eat it, and the overlooker took it, and
gave it to the pigs.<P>You are speaking of the breakfast?<BR>--Yes.<P>How far
had you to go for dinner?<BR>--We could not go home to dinner.<P>Where did you
dine?<BR>--In the mill.<P>Did you live far from the mill?<BR>--Yes, two
miles.<P>Had you a clock?<BR>--No, we had not.<P>Supposing you had not been in
time enough in the morning at these mills, what would have been the
consequence?<BR>--We should have been quartered.<P>What do you mean by
that?<BR>--If we were a quarter of an hour too late, they would take off half
an hour; we only got a penny an hour, and they would take a halfpenny
more.<P>The fine was much more considerable than the loss of
time?<BR>--Yes.<P>Were you also beaten for being too late?<BR>--No, I was never
beaten myself, I have seen the boys beaten for being too late.<P>Were you
generally there in time?<BR>--Yes; my mother had been up at 4 o'clock in the
morning, and at 2 o'clock in the morning; the colliers used to go to their work
about 3 or 4 o'clock, and when she heard them stirring she has got up out of
her warm bed, and gone out and asked them the time; and I have sometimes been
at Hunslet Car at 2 o'clock in the morning, when it was streaming down with
rain, and we have had to stay until the mill was opened.

Peter Smart,
called in; and Examined.<p>

You say you were locked up night and
day?<BR>--Yes.<P>Do the children ever attempt to run away?<BR>--Very
often.<P>Were they pusued and brought back again?<BR>--Yes, the overseer
pursued them, and brought them back.<P>Did you ever attempt to run
away?<BR>--Yes, I ran away twice.<P>And you were brought back?<BR>--Yes; and I
was sent up to the master's loft, and thrashed with a whip for running
away.<P>Were you bound to this man?<BR>--Yes, for six years.<P>By whom were you
bound?<BR>--My mother got 15s. for the six years.<P>Do you know whether the
children were, in point of fact, compelled to stop during the whole time for
which they were engaged?<BR>--Yes, they were.<P>By law?<BR>--I cannot say by
law; but they were compelled by the master; I never saw any law used there but
the law of their own hands.<P>To what mill did you next go?<BR>--To Mr.
Webster's, at Battus Den, within eleven miles of Dundee.<P>In what situation
did you act there?<BR>--I acted as overseer.<P>At 17 years of
age?<BR>--Yes.<P>Did you inflict the same punishment that you yourself had
experienced?<BR>--I went as an overseer; not as a slave, but as a
slave-driver.<P>What were the hours of labour in that mill?<BR>--My master told
me that I had to produce a certain quantity of yarn; the hours were at that
time fourteen; I said that I was not able to produce the quantity of yarn that
was required; I told him if he took the timepiece out of the mill I would
produce that quantity, and after that time I found no difficulty in producing
the quantity.<P>How long have you worked per day in order to produce the
quantity your master required?<BR>--I have wrought nineteen hours.<P>Was this a
water-mill?<BR>--Yes, water and steam both.<P>To what time have you
worked?<BR>--I have seen the mill going till it was past 12 o'clock on the
Saturday night.<P>So that the mill was still working on the Sabbath
morning?<BR>--Yes.<P>Were the workmen paid by the piece, or by the
day?<BR>--No, all had stated wages.<P>Did not that almost compel you to use
great severity to the hands then under you?<BR>--Yes; I was compelled often to
beat them, in order to get them to attend to their work, from their being
over-wrought.<P>Were not the children exceedingly fatigued at that
time?<BR>--Yes, exceedingly fatigued.<P>Were the children bound in the same way
in that mill?<BR>--No; they were bound from one year's end to another, for
twelve months.<P>Did you keep the hands locked up in the same way in that
mill?<BR>--Yes, we locked up the mill; but we did not lock the bothy.<P>Did you
find that the children were unable to pursue their labour properly to that
extent?<BR>--Yes; they have been brought to that condition, that I have gone
and fetched up the doctor to them, to see what was the matter with them, and to
know whether they were able to rise or not able to rise; they were not at all
able to rise; we have had great difficulty in getting them up.<P>When that was
the case, how long have they been in bed, generally speaking?<BR>--Perhaps not
above four or five hours in their beds.<p>
