TW 6.18.15
-> Discuss Egypt and Mesopotamia (Simmilarities and Differences)
* Egypt and Mesopotamia are very close, and share many geographic simmilarities such as the huge desserts and intimidating mountain rages close by. The plant, animal, and insect life were simmilar though differences arose in settlement location. The difference being that in egypt flooding the nile was not only good but nessicary. For mesopotamian people floods were terrifying horrific and tragicly powerful events, due to being located in a marsh between 2 large rivers.

TW 6.19.15
-> How does ancient egypt represent the statement 'geography is destiny'?
* Ancient egypt had a ton of positive features within its borders and was sldo well protected by dessert, the sea and mountain rages. Within egypt was the nile river which egyptians belived was the holiest place on earth. They had many plants for crops, and many animals to domesticate. Later, after the ancients had established their civilisation they had the right resources not only for war, but also for trade.

TW 6.22.15
-> Why are the hebrews an important source of western civilisation?
* The hebrew people are important because they had strong traditions, both spiritual and cultural. The keep a solid unified identity and record their history in the 5 books of moses, and then the stories of david and solomon. They worship a single god, and this defines them as seperate from other people of the canan area. Their ability to hold onto their identity even after losing their homeland ensured that their culture would survive, and today the vast majority of religion is tied to the same god of abraham.

TW 6.23.15
-> Contrast the Greeks perspective on Gods to that of previous civilizations discussed
* The greek gods are Human! Where the babylonians had surreal monsters and big eye gods with scary features, and the Hebrews worshiped an abstract god, the Greek gods are more like a royal family. They have human emotions and flaws, and look human. They make mistakes. They are also not as destructivly vengeful as other godsa and they do not require human sacrifice. 

TW 2.24.15
* The greek people were proud, smart, thinking people. They placed very strong emphasis on being "the best". They made amazing art, Invented philosophy, placed themselves very close to their gods. The spartans believed they were descened from herculese himself, a half man--half god. They valued freedom and thought. They respected fellow Helen Polis, even if they disagreed. They saw themselves as above mysticism - at least more so than other people. All these values combined into a democratic form of government, though they still had slaves and women could not vote. They were still able to come together within a democratic system wich allowed them to contructivly disagree with eachother within.

TW 6.25.15
* The democratic system we are fammiliar with today evolved over a period of time to cope with growing populations while maintaining greek virtues of respect and logical thought. Firstly to prevent revolt Solon excused all debt, which some speculate was a way for his friends to do ancient insider trading by taking out timely loans. Pisisthanes later took this a step further, confiscating lands from the wealthy aristocrats and nobels to distribute to common people. His grandson, cielisthenes(?) saw his actions as temporary and reformed the greek constitution to give more rights to the common citizen.

TW 6.28.15
* Socrates felt that knowledge was power, and that power should be democratized for the people. He felt that reason was a tool that anybody could use to test truths and ask questions. He was a threat to religious power because he thought that logic and reason could tell you what is right and wrong better than simply asking the authorities.

TW 7.1.15
* The helenistic age shares many similarities with modern times. The poeople's government was fragmented across multiple nations, simmilar to the now ex british colonies of america, india, hong kong etc... All under their own government but still exchanging culture and trading goods. They shared a common mindset of independance inherited from their common cultural ancestors.

TW 7.2.15
* Hellenistic philosophy has large impact in modern times. Notable examples are sophists, which have influenced the modern concepts of art, fashion and beauty in profound ways. Wealth tends toward sophistication, and the medias plat to these ideals. Stoicism has also held up well in modern time, with military and political figures along with corprate executives all striving for stoic virtue. Of course most prevelant among the masses is unbridled hedonism.

TW 7.7.15
* Rome was said to have been founded by Romulus and Remus, who were raised by wolves. The virtues that romans espoused were therefore related to strength and power. Romans were expected to be stoic. After the punic wars, rome became very powerful and wealthy. Slaves did most work and people tended towards brutality and corruption.

TW 7.9.15
* Before the punic wars, rome held strong virtues of honor, power and strength. After the punic wars rome became bloated and wealthy. Romans were more materialistic and lived in excess. Romans were more self centered and arrogant, and harsh in their violent punishments of crime and rebellion.

TW 7.13.15
* Agustus was like Jesus, another reformer of his age. He offered veterans bennifits, instituted police and fire marshal forces, and staved off rebellion by taking care of his people the best ways that he could. He built infrastructure and weakened the senate to keep his grip of control. Jesus also offered to the poor and the weak and sought to tear down old hebrew laws that he saw were unjust and consolidated power and followers.

TW 7.15.15
* Christianity can be seen as a hellenistic mutation of judaeism. The hellenistic world brought new ideas to judea, namely the importance of spiritual salvation. The greek people wanted to oerfect themselves and get closer to the gods. The hebrew people resisted these ideas at first but then radicalists reframed the concepts into hebrew mythos and the christian sect split from the cultural shared identity of the hebrews to a new shared identity revolving around salvation and the messiah.

TW 7.15.15
* As the years after lead waterways were developed in rome wore on, rome became weaker and more violent. Leaders in rome were becomming more and more foreceful and the masses were becomming more and more disillusioned with the roman empire. In this weakness, an internal power struggle gives way to Emperor Constantine, the first christian ruler of rome.
