        <p>Volunteers in Oklahoma, California, and Connecticut along with others throughout the world, 
          are doing what we can to make this happen. We have sent out almost 500,000 
          free books, <a href="book.htm"> PEACE PILGRIM, HER LIFE AND WORK IN&nbsp;HER 
          OWN WORDS</a> and two million booklets, <a href="steps.htm"> 
          STEPS TOWARD INNER PEACE</a>. Requests for thousands of free audio  tapes and DVDs of Peace Pilgrim speaking have also been filled. Her message 
          is now in over 100 countries. The book is in 10 languages and the STEPS 
          booklet is available online in <a href="../../htmfiles/WorldSteps.htm"> 29 different languages</a>. </p>
        <p>We do not advertise. Knowledge about Peace Pilgrim spreads by word 
          of mouth, editors mention Peace Pilgrim in their magazines; some authors 
          have a whole chapter about Peace Pilgrim in their books; others quote 
          her. Hundreds of such publications give our address and offer of a free 
          book. Everyday we receive letters and phone calls from those who want 
          Peace Pilgrim books and tapes. </p>
        <p>We have received thousands of letters, many of them saying that Peace 
          Pilgrim has changed their lives. They write: &quot;We feel there is 
          no one who would not be changed at least in some small way by reading 
          your book.&quot; And from England, &quot;I am just overwhelmed by her 
          good news, and I want every one in the world to read this. . . if I 
          can share this book with some of my peace loving friends I will be overjoyed.&quot; 
        </p>
        <p>We give these books and tapes free to those who ask. Because Peace 
          Pilgrim's message is so inspiring readers send in <a href="donate.htm">donations</a> 
          to help spread her message. We appreciate contributions, for they make 
          the free distribution of these books possible. </p>
