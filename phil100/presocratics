<h1>Presocratic Philosophy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sat Mar 10, 2007; substantive revision Mon Nov 5, 2012</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The Presocratics were 6<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> century BCE
Greek thinkers who introduced a new way of inquiring into the world
and the place of human beings in it. They were recognized in antiquity
as the first philosophers and scientists of the Western
tradition. This article is a general introduction to the most
important Presocratic philosophers and the main themes of Presocratic
thought. More detailed discussions can be found by consulting the
articles on these philosophers (and related topics) in the SEP (listed
below). The standard collection of texts for the Presocratics is that
by H. Diels revised by W. Kranz (abbreviated as DK). In it, each
thinker is assigned an identifying chapter number (e.g., Heraclitus is
22, Anaxagoras 59); then the reports from ancient authors about that
thinker's life and thought are collected in a section of
&ldquo;testimonies&rdquo; (A) and numbered in order, while the
passages the editors take to be direct quotations are collected and
numbered in a section of &ldquo;fragments&rdquo; (B). Alleged
imitations in later authors are sometimes added in a section labeled
C. Thus, each piece of text can be uniquely identified: DK 59B12.3
identifies line 3 of Anaxagoras fragment 12; DK 22A1 identifies
testimonium 1 on Heraclitus.</p>

<h2><a name="WhoWerPrePhi">1. Who Were the Presocratic Philosophers?</a></h2>

<p>

Our understanding of the Presocratics is complicated by the incomplete
nature of our evidence. Most of them wrote at least one
&ldquo;book&rdquo; (short pieces of prose writing, it seems, or, in
some cases, poems of not great length), but no complete work
survives. Instead, we are dependent on later philosophers, historians,
and compilers of collections of ancient wisdom for disconnected
quotations (fragments) and reports about their views
(<em>testimonia</em>). In some cases, these sources had direct access
to the works of the Presocratics, but in many others, the line is
indirect and often depends on the work of Aristotle, Theophrastus, and
other ancient philosophers who did have access. The sources for the
fragments and testimonia made selective use of the material available
to them, in accordance with their own special, and varied, interests
in the early thinkers. (For analyses of the doxographic tradition, and
the influence of Aristotle and Theophrastus on later sources, see
Mansfeld 1999, Runia 2008, and Mansfeld and Runia 1997, 2009a, and 2009b.)
Although any account of a Presocratic thinker has to be a
reconstruction, we should not be overly pessimistic about the
possibility of reaching a historically responsible understanding of
these early Greek thinkers.</p>

<p>

Calling this group &ldquo;Presocratic philosophers&rdquo; raises
certain difficulties. The term was made current by Hermann Diels in
the nineteenth century, and was meant to mark a contrast between
Socrates who was interested in moral problems, and his predecessors,
who were supposed to be primarily concerned with cosmological and
physical speculation.  &ldquo;Presocratic,&rdquo; if taken strictly as
a chronological term, is not quite accurate, for the last of them were
contemporaneous with Socrates and even Plato. Moreover, several of the
early Greek thinkers explored questions about ethics and the best way
to live a human life.  The term may also suggest that these thinkers
are somehow inferior to Socrates and Plato, of interest only as their
predecessors, and its suggestion of archaism may imply that philosophy
only becomes interesting when we arrive at the classical period of
Plato and Aristotle. Some scholars now deliberately avoid the term,
but if we take it to refer to the early Greek thinkers who were not
influenced by the views of Socrates, whether his predecessors or
contemporaries, there is probably no harm in using it. (For
discussions of the notion of Presocratic philosophy, see Long's
introduction in Long 1999, Laks 2006, and the articles in Laks and
Louguet 2002.) </p>

<p>

A second problem lies in referring to these thinkers as
philosophers. That is almost certainly not how they could have
described themselves. While it is true that Heraclitus says that
&ldquo;those who are lovers of wisdom must be inquirers into many
things&rdquo; (22B35), the word he uses, <em>philosophos</em>, does
not have the special sense that it acquires in the works of Plato and
Aristotle, when the philosopher is contrasted with both the ordinary
person and other experts, including the sophist (particularly in
Plato), or in the resulting modern sense in which we can distinguish
philosophy from physics or psychology; yet the Presocratics certainly
saw themselves as set apart from the ordinary person and also from
other thinkers (poets and historical writers, for example) who were
their predecessors and contemporaries. As the fragment from Heraclitus
shows, the early Greek philosophers thought of themselves as inquirers
into many things, and the range of their inquiry was vast. They had
views about the nature of the world, and these views encompass what we
today call physics, chemistry, geology, meteorology, astronomy,
embryology, and psychology (and other areas of natural inquiry), as
well as theology, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. In the
earliest of the Presocratics, the Milesians, it can indeed be
difficult to discern the strictly philosophical aspects of the views
in the evidence available to us. Nevertheless, despite the danger of
misunderstanding and thus underestimating these thinkers on account of
anachronism, there is an important sense in which it is quite
reasonable to refer to them as philosophers.  That sense is inherent
in Aristotle's view (see, e.g., <em>Met</em>. I, <em>Phys</em>. I,
<em>De Anima</em> I): these thinkers were his predecessors in a
particular sort of inquiry, and even though Aristotle thinks that they
were all, for one reason or another, unsuccessful and even amateurish,
he sees in them a similarity such that he can trace a line of
continuity of both subject and method from their work to his own. The
questions that the early Greek philosophers asked, the sorts of answers
that they gave, and the views that they had of their own inquiries
were the foundation for the development of philosophy as it came to be
defined in the work of Plato and Aristotle and their
successors. Perhaps the fundamental characteristic is the commitment
to explain the world in terms of its own inherent
principles.</p>

<p>

By contrast, consider the 7<sup>th</sup> century BCE poem of Hesiod,
his <em>Theogony</em> (genealogy of the gods). Hesiod tells the
traditional story of the Olympian gods, beginning with Chaos, a vague
divine primordial entity or condition. From Chaos, a sequence of gods
is generated, often by sexual congress, but sometimes no particular
cause is given. Each divine figure that arises is connected with a
part of the physical universe, so his theogony is also a cosmogony (an
account of the generation of the world). The divinities (and the
associated parts of the world) come to be and struggle violently among
themselves; finally Zeus triumphs and establishes and maintains an
order of power among the others who remain. Hesiod's world is one in
which the major divinities are individuals who behave like super-human
beings (Gaia or earth, Ouranos or sky, Cronos &mdash; an unlocated
regal power, Zeus); some of the others are personified characteristics
(e.g., Momus, blame; and Dusnomia, lawlessness).  For the Greeks, the
fundamental properties of divinity are immortality and power, and each
of Hesiod's characters has these properties (even though in the story
some are defeated, and seem to be destroyed). Hesiod's story is like a
vast Hollywood-style family history, with envy, rage, love, and lust
all playing important parts in the coming-to-be of the world as we
know it. The earliest rulers of the universe are violently overthrown
by their offspring (Ouranos is overthrown by Cronos, Cronos by
Zeus). Zeus insures his continued power by swallowing his first
consort Metis (counsel or wisdom); by this he prevents the predicted
birth of rivals and acquires her attribute of wisdom
(<em>Theogony</em> 886&ndash;900). In a second poem, <em>Works and
Days</em>, Hesiod pays more attention to human beings, telling the
story of earlier, greater creatures who died out or were destroyed by
themselves or Zeus.  Humans were created by Zeus, are under his power,
and are subject to his judgment and to divine intervention for either
good or ill.  (A good discussion of the Hesiodic myths in relation to
Presocratic philosophy can be found in McKirahan 2011.  Burkert 2008
surveys influence from the east on the development of Presocratic
philosophy, especially the myths, astronomy, and cosmogony of the
Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians.) </p>

<p>

Hesiod's world, like Homer's, is one that is god-saturated, where the
gods may intervene in all aspects of the world, from the weather to
mundane particulars of human life, reaching into the ordinary world
order from outside, in a way that humans must accept but cannot
ultimately understand. The Presocratics reject this account, instead
seeing the world as a <em>kosmos</em>, an ordered natural arrangement
that is inherently intelligible and not subject to supra-natural
intervention. A striking example is Xenophanes 21B32: &ldquo;And she
whom they call Iris, this too is by nature cloud / purple, red, and
greeny yellow to behold.&rdquo; Iris, the rainbow, traditional
messenger of the gods, is after all, not supra-natural, not a sign
from the gods on Olympus who are outside of and immune from the usual
world order; rather it is, in its essence, colored cloud. </p>

<p>

Calling the Presocratics <em>philosophers</em> also suggests that they
share a certain outlook with one another; an outlook that can be
contrasted with that of other early Greek writers. Although scholars
disagree about the extent of the divergence between the early Greek
philosophers and their non-philosophical predecessors and
contemporaries, it seems evident that Presocratic thought exhibits a
significant difference not only in its understanding of the nature of
the world, but also in its view of the sort of explanation of it that
is possible. This is evident in Heraclitus. Although Heraclitus
asserts that those who love wisdom must be inquirers into many things,
inquiry alone is not sufficient. At 22B40 he rebukes four of his
predecessors: &ldquo;Much learning does not teach understanding; else
it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and
Hecataeus.&rdquo; Heraclitus' implicit contrast is with himself;
in 22B1 he suggests that he alone truly understands all things,
because he grasps the account that enables him to &ldquo;distinguish
each thing in accordance with its nature&rdquo; and say how it is. For
Heraclitus there is an underlying principle that unites and explains
everything. It is this that others have failed to see and
understand. According to Heraclitus, the four have amassed a great
deal of information &mdash; Hesiod was a traditional source of
information about the gods, Pythagoras was renowned for his learning
and especially views about how one ought to live, Xenophanes taught
about the proper view of the gods and the natural world, Hecataeus was
an early historian &mdash; but because they have failed to grasp the
deeper significance of the facts available to them, their unconnected
bits of knowledge do not constitute understanding. Just as the world
is an ordered arrangement, so human knowledge of that world must be
ordered in a certain way.</p>

<h2><a name="Mil">2. The Milesians</a></h2>

<p>
                 
In his account of his predecessors' searches for &ldquo;causes
and principles&rdquo; of the natural world and natural phenomena,
Aristotle says that Thales of Miletus (a city in Ionia, on the west
coast of what is now Turkey) was the first to engage in such inquiry.
He seems to have lived around the beginning of the 6<sup>th</sup> c.
BCE. Aristotle mentions that some more ancient persons placed great
importance on water (<em>Metaphysics</em> 983b27&ndash;33), like Thales
himself, and then later raises the question of whether perhaps Hesiod
was the first to look for a cause of motion and change
(984b23ff.). These suggestions are rhetorical: Aristotle does not
seriously imply that those he mentions are engaged in the same
sort of inquiry as he thinks Thales was. Two other Greek thinkers from
this very early period, Anaximander and Anaximenes, were also from
Miletus, and although the ancient tradition that the three were
related as master and pupil may not be correct, there are enough
fundamental similarities in their views to justify treating them
together. </p>

<p>

The tradition claims that Thales predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC
(11A5), introduced geometry into Greece from Egypt (11A11), and
produced some engineering marvels; Anaximander is reported to have
invented the gnomon, that raised piece of a sundial whose shadow marks
time (12A1), and to have been the first to draw a map of the inhabited
world (12A6). Regardless of whether these reports are correct
(and in the case of Thales' prediction they almost certainly are
not), they indicate something important about the Milesians: their
interests in measuring and explaining celestial and terrestrial
phenomena were as strong as their concern with the more abstract
inquiries into the causes and principles of substance and change that
Aristotle attributes to them (Algra 1999, White 2008). 
They did not see the scientific and philosophical questions as
belonging to separate disciplines, requiring distinct methods of
inquiry.   The assumptions and principles that we (along with
Aristotle) see as constituting the philosophical foundations of their
theories are, for the most part, implicit in the claims that they
make. Nevertheless, it is legitimate to treat the Milesians as
having philosophical views, even though no clear statements of these
views or specific arguments for them can be found in the surviving
fragments and testimonia. </p>

<p>
                 
Aristotle's comments do not sound as if they were based on first-hand
knowledge of Thales' views, and the doxographical reports say
that Thales did not write a book. Yet Aristotle is confident that
Thales belongs, even if honorifically, to that group of thinkers that
he calls &ldquo;inquirers into nature&rdquo; and distinguishes him
from earlier poetical &ldquo;myth-makers.&rdquo; In Book I of the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle claims that the earliest of these,
among whom he places the Milesians, explained things only in terms of
their matter (<em>Met</em>. I.3 983b6&ndash;18). This claim is
anachronistic in that it presupposes Aristotle's own novel view that a
complete explanation must encompass four factors: what he called the
material, efficient, formal, and final causes. Yet there is something
in what Aristotle says. In his discussion, Aristotle links
Thales' claim that the world rests on water with the view that
water was the <em>arch&#275;</em>, or fundamental principle, and he
adds that &ldquo;that from which they come to be is a principle of all
things&rdquo; (983b24&ndash;25; 11A12). He suggests that Thales chose
water because of its fundamental role in coming-to-be, nutrition, and
growth, and claims that water is the origin of the nature of moist
things. </p>

<p>

Aristotle's general assertion about the first thinkers who gave
accounts of nature (and his specific discussion of Thales'
reliance on water as a first principle) brings out a difficulty in
interpreting the early Presocratics. According to Aristotle's general
account, the Presocratics claimed that there was a single enduring
material stuff that is both the origin of all things and their
continuing nature. Thus, on this view, when Thales says that the first
principle is water, he should be understood as claiming both that the
original state of things was water and that even now (despite
appearances), everything is really water in some state or another. The
change from the original state to the present one involves changes in
the material stuff such that although it may not now appear to be
water everywhere (but seems to be airier or earthier than water in its
usual state, or its original one), there is no transformation of water
into a different kind of stuff (air or earth, for instance). Yet, when
Aristotle comes to give what details he can of Thales' view, he
suggests only that for Thales, water was the first principle because
everything comes from water. Water, then, was perhaps the original
state of things for Thales, and water is a necessary condition for
everything that is generated naturally, but Aristotle's summary of
Thales' view does not imply that Thales claimed that water
endures through whatever changes have occurred since the original
state, and now just has some new or additional properties. Thales may
well have thought that certain characteristics of the original water
persisted: in particular its capacity for motion (which must have been
innate in order to generate the changes from the original state). This
is suggested by Thales' reported claims that the lodestone (with
its magnetic properties) and amber (which when rubbed exhibits powers
of attraction through static electricity) have souls and that all
things are full of gods. Aristotle surmises that Thales identified
soul (that which makes a thing alive and thus capable of motion) with
something in the whole universe, and so supposed that everything was
full of gods (11A22)&mdash;water, or soul, being a divine natural
principle. Certainly the claim that the lodestone has soul suggests
this account. Given that the analysis of change (both qualitative and
substantial) in terms of a substratum that gains and loses properties
is Aristotelian (although perhaps foreshadowed in Plato), it is not
surprising that the earlier views were unclear on this issue, and it
is probable that the Milesian view did not distinguish the notions of
an original matter and an enduring underlying stuff.  </p>

<p>
                 
The reports about Thales show him employing a certain kind of
explanation: ultimately the explanation of why things are as they are
is grounded in water as the basic stuff of the universe and the changes
that it undergoes through its own inherent nature. In this,
Thales marks a radical change from all other previous sorts of accounts
of the world (both Greek and non-Greek). Like the other
Presocratics, Thales sees nature as a complete and self-ordering
system, and sees no reason to call on divine intervention from outside
the natural world to supplement his account&mdash;water itself may be
divine, but it is not something that intervenes in the natural world
from outside. While the evidence for Thales' naturalistic
account is circumstantial, this attitude can be directly verified for
Anaximander. </p>

<p>

In the one fragment that can be securely attributed to Anaximander
(although the extent of the implied quotation is uncertain), he
emphasizes the orderly nature of the universe, and indicates that the
order is internal rather than imposed from outside. Simplicius, a
6<sup>th</sup> c. CE commentator on Aristotle's <em>Physics</em>,
writes:  </p>

<blockquote>

Of those who say that [the first principle] is one and moving and
indefinite, Anaximander, son of Praxiades, a Milesian who became
successor and pupil to Thales, said that the indefinite (<em>to
apeiron</em>) is both principle (<em>arch&#275;</em>) and element
(<em>stoicheion</em>) of the things that are, and he was the first to
introduce this name of the principle. He says that it is neither water
nor any other of the so-called elements, but some other indefinite
(<em>apeiron</em>) nature, from which come to be all the heavens and
the worlds in them; and those things, from which there is coming-to-be
for the things that are, are also those into which is their
passing-away, in accordance with what must be. For they give penalty
(<em>dik&ecirc;</em>) and recompense to one another for their
injustice (<em>adikia</em>) in accordance with the ordering of
time&mdash;speaking of them in rather poetical terms. It is clear that
having seen the change of the four elements into each other, he did
not think it fit to make some one of these underlying subject, but
something else, apart from these.  (Simplicius, <em>Commentary on
Aristotle's Physics</em> 24, lines 13ff. = 12A9 and
B1)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>

</blockquote>

<p>

Thus, there is an original (and originating) indefinite stuff, from which all the
heavens and the worlds in them come to be. This claim probably
means that the original state of the universe was an indefinitely large
mass of stuff that was also indefinite in its
 character.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup> 
 This stuff
then gave rise through its own inherent power to the ingredients that
themselves constitute the world as we perceive it. </p>

<p>

A testimony about Anaximander from Pseudo-Plutarch (12A10) says that
&ldquo;Something productive of hot and cold was separated off from the
eternal at the genesis of this world and from this a sphere of flame
grew around the air around the earth like the bark around a
tree.&rdquo;  Neither the cause nor the precise process of
separation is explained, but it is probable that Anaximander would have
thought of the original source of change as part of the character of
the indefinite itself. The passage from Simplicius shows that
Anaximander does not think that the eternal indefinite stuff gives rise
directly to the cosmos as we know it. Rather, the
<em>apeiron</em> somehow generates the opposites hot and cold. 
Hot and cold are themselves stuffs with powers; and it is the actions
of these stuffs/powers that produce the things that come to be in our
world. The opposites act on, dominate, and contain each other,
producing a regulated structure; thus things pass away into those
things from which they came to be. It is this structured
arrangement that Anaximander refers to when he speaks of justice and
reparation.   Over the course of time, the cycles of the
seasons, the rotations of the heavens, and other sorts of cyclical
change (including coming-to-be and passing-away) are regulated and thus
form a system. This system, ruled by the justice of the ordering
of time is in sharp contrast with the chaotic and capricious world of
the personified Greek gods who interfere in the workings of the heavens
and in the affairs of human beings (Kahn 1985a, Vlastos 1947, Guthrie
1962).  </p>

<p>
                 
  The pattern that can be seen in Thales and Anaximander of an
original basic stuff giving rise to the phenomena of the cosmos
continues in the views of the third of the Milesians, Anaximenes. 
He replaces Anaximander's <em>apeiron</em> with air, thus
eliminating the first stage of the coming-to-be of the cosmos (the
something productive of hot and cold). Rather, he returns to an
originating stuff more like Thales' water. In 13A5,
Aristotle's associate Theophrastus, quoted by Simplicius,
speculates that Anaximenes chose air because he agreed that a basic
principle must be neutral (as Anaximander's <em>apeiron</em> is)
but not so lacking in properties that it seems to be nothing at
all. Air can apparently take on various properties of color,
temperature, humidity, motion, taste, and smell. Moreover,
according to Theophrastus, Anaximenes explicitly states the natural
mechanism for change; it is the condensation and rarefaction of air
that naturally determine the particular characters of the things
produced from the originating stuff. Rarified, air becomes fire;
more and more condensed, it becomes progressively wind, cloud, water,
earth, and finally stones. &ldquo;The rest,&rdquo; says
Theophrastus, &ldquo;come to be from these.&rdquo;  Plutarch says
that condensation and rarefaction are connected with cooling and
heating, and he gives the example of breath (13B1). Releasing air
from the mouth with compressed lips produces cool air (as in cooling
soup by blowing on it), but relaxed lips produce warm air (as when one
blows on cold hands to warm them up). </p>

<p>
                 
Does the originating stuff persist through the changes that it
undergoes in the generating processes?  Aristotle's account suggests
that it does, that Anaximenes, for instance, would have thought that
stone was really air, although in an altered state, just as we might
say that ice is really water, cooled to a point where it goes from a
liquid to a solid state. Because the water does not cease to be water
when it is cooled and becomes ice, it can return to a liquid when
heated and then become a gas when more heat is applied. On this view,
the Milesians were material monists, committed to the reality of a
single material stuff that undergoes many alterations but persists
through the changes (Barnes 1979, Guthrie 1962, Sedley, 2007 and
2009). Yet there are reasons to doubt that this was actually the
Milesian view. It presumes that the early Greek thinkers anticipated
Aristotle's general theory that change requires enduring underlying
substances that gain and lose properties. The earliest Greeks thought
more in terms of powers (Vlastos 1947, Heidel 1906), and the
metaphysical problem of what it is to be a substance was yet to be
addressed. Clearly the Milesians were interested in the original stuff
from which the world was formed (Anaximander and Anaximenes are
explicit about transformations of such an eternal original stuff), but
the view that this endured as a single substratum may not have been
theirs. Rather, it has been suggested by Graham (1997 and 2006) that
the Milesians were not, in Aristotle's sense, material monists. On
this view, the original/originating stuff is transformed into other
substances.  Anaximenes, for instance, may have thought that the
change from air to water does not involve the persistence of air as
any sort of substratum. There is no special role that air plays in the
theory except that it is the original stuff and so first in an
analysis of the law-like cyclical changes that produce various
substances as the cosmos develops (Graham 2006, ch. 4). Such an
interpretation suggests how different the Milesian conception of the
world is from our own, or even from Aristotle's.</p>

<h2><a name="XenColHerEph">3. Xenophanes of Colophon and Heraclitus of Ephesus</a></h2>

<p>

Living in the last years of the 6<sup>th</sup> c. and the beginning of
the 5<sup>th</sup>, Xenophanes and Heraclitus continue the Milesian
interest in the nature of the physical world, and both offer
cosmological accounts; yet they go further than the Milesians not only
through their focus on the human subject and the expanded range of
their physical explanations, but by investigating the nature of
inquiry itself. Both explore the possibility of human understanding
and question its limits. Recent work on Xenophanes' epistemology and
his cosmology has made much of his scientific work clearer and more
impressive (Lesher 1992, Mourelatos 2008). He has, to a great extent,
been rescued from his traditional status as a minor traveling
poet-sage who railed against the glorification of athletes and made
some interesting comments about the relativity of human conceptions of
the gods. Instead, he has come to be seen as an original thinker in
his own right who influenced later philosophers trying to distinguish
the realms of the human and the divine, and exploring the possibility
that human beings can gain knowledge and wisdom, i.e., are able to
have a god's eye view of things and understand them. </p>

<p>

Xenophanes claims that all meteorological phenomena are clouds,
colored, moving, incandescent: rainbow, St. Elmo's Fire, the sun,
the moon. Clouds are fed by exhalations from the land and sea
(mixtures of earth and water). The motions of earth and water,
and hence of clouds, account for all the things we find around us. His
explanations of meteorological and heavenly phenomena lead to a
naturalistic science:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

She whom they call Iris, this too is by nature (<em>pephuke</em>)
cloud <br /> purple, and red, and greeny-yellow to behold. (21B32)</p>

<p>

Xenophanes says that the star-like phenomena seen when aboard ship,
which some call the Dioscuri, are cloudlets, glimmering because of
their kind of motion. (A39)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

In the 1980's Alexander Mourelatos argued that Xenophanes
employs an important new pattern of explanation: <em>X</em> is really
<em>Y</em>, where <em>Y</em> reveals the true character of
<em>X</em>. Xenophanes signals this by the use of <em>pephuke</em> in
B32, and no doubt it (or some word like it) was there in the original of A39 as
well. Xenophanes thus provides an account of a phenomenon often taken
to be a sign from the divine&mdash;Iris as the messenger; the
Dioscuri (St. Elmo's fire) as comfort for sailors&mdash;that
reduces it to a natural occurrence.  </p>

<p>

That meteorological phenomena are not divine is not all that
Xenophanes has to say about the gods. He notes anthropomorphic
tendencies in conceptions of the gods (B14: &ldquo;Mortals suppose that
the gods are born, and have their own dress, voice, and body;&rdquo;
B16: &ldquo;Ethiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed and dark,
Thracians, that theirs are grey-eyed and red-haired&rdquo;). He
also famously suggests that horses, oxen, and lions would have equine,
bovine, and leonine gods (B15). Yet Xenophanes also makes
positive claims about the nature of the divine, including the claim
that there is a single greatest god:</p>

<blockquote>

One god greatest among gods and men,
<br />
Resembling mortals neither in body nor in thought.
<br />
&hellip;  whole [he] sees, whole [he] thinks, and whole [he]
hears,
<br />
but completely without toil he agitates all things by the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought of his mind.
<br />
&hellip; always he remains in the same (state), agitated not at all,
<br />
nor is it fitting that he come and go to different places at different
times. (B23, 24, 25, 26)

</blockquote>

<p>

While indifferent to the affairs of human beings, Xenophanes'
divine being understands and controls a cosmos that is infused with
divine thinking, understood, organized, and managed by divine
intellection. Moreover, B18 suggests that Xenophanes is
optimistic about the capacities of human intelligence:</p>

<blockquote>
 Indeed not even from the beginning did the gods indicate all things
to mortals, but, in time, inquiring, they discover better.
</blockquote>

<p>

Having already removed the gods as bearers of knowledge to humans,
denying that the divine takes an active interest in what mortals can or
cannot know, Xenophanes asserts the conclusion to be drawn from his
naturalistic interpretation of phenomena: the gods are not going to
reveal anything to us; we are epistemologically autonomous and must
rely on our own capacity for inquiry. That way, we
&ldquo;discover better,&rdquo; as he says (see Lesher 1991). This
is an optimistic conclusion, suggesting that human thought can mimic
divine understanding, at least to some degree. Xenophanes'
own practice seems consistent with the claims of B18; his own inquiries
and explanations led him to unified explanations of terrestrial and
celestial phenomena. Yet B34 suggests skepticism: </p>

<blockquote>

And of course the clear and certain truth no man has seen,
<br />
nor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about
all things;
<br />
for even if, in the best case, he should chance to speak what is the
case,
<br />
all the same, he himself does not know; but opinion is found over
all.

</blockquote>

<p>

Whether this is global or limited skepticism is controversial
(Lesher 1992 and 1994 argues for a limited interpretation). 
Xenophanes stresses the difficulty of coming to certainty, particularly
about things beyond our direct experience.</p>

<p>
                 
Famously obscure, accused by Plato of incoherence and by Aristotle of
denying the law of non-contradiction, Heraclitus writes in an
aphoristic style, his apparently paradoxical claims presenting
difficulties to any interpreter. Nevertheless, he raises
important questions about knowledge and the nature of the world. 
The opening of Heraclitus' book refers to a &ldquo;<em>logos</em>
which holds
 forever.&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup> 
 There is disagreement about exactly what
Heraclitus meant by using the term <em>logos</em>, but it is clear from
22B1 and B2 as well as B50 and other fragments that he refers to an
objective law-like principle that governs the cosmos, and which it is
possible (but difficult) for humans to come to understand. There
is a single order that directs all things (&ldquo;all things are
one&rdquo; B50); this order is divine, and is sometimes connected by
humans with the traditional gods (it is &ldquo;both unwilling and
willing to be called by the name of Zeus&rdquo; B32). Just as
Zeus, in the traditional view, controls from Olympus with a
thunderbolt, so this single ordered system steers and controls the
whole cosmos from within. The sign of the unchanging order of the
eternal system is fire&mdash;just as fire is always changing and
always the same, so with the <em>logos</em> that embodies the order and
rules all things. </p>

<p>

The plan or order that steers the cosmos is, itself, a rational
order. This means not only that it is non-capricious and so
intelligible (in the sense that humans can, at least in principle, come
to understand it), it is also an intelligent system: there is an
intelligent plan at work, if only in the sense of the cosmos working
itself out in accordance with rational
 principles.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup> 
 Consider B114:</p>

<blockquote>

Those who would speak with understanding must ground themselves
firmly in that which is common to all, just as a city does in its law,
and even more firmly!  For all human laws are nourished by one
law, the divine; for it rules as far at it wishes and suffices for all,
and is still more than enough.

</blockquote>

<p>

Heraclitus is not only claiming that human prescriptive law must
harmonize with divine law, but he is also asserting that divine law encompasses both
the universal laws of the cosmos itself and the particular laws of men.
 The cosmos itself is an intelligent, eternal (and hence divine)
system that orders and regulates itself in an intelligent way: the
<em>logos</em> is the account of this self-regulation. We can
come to grasp and understand at least part of this divine system. 
This is not merely because we ourselves are part of (contained in) the
system, but because we have, through our capacity for intelligent
thinking, the power to grasp the system as a whole, through knowing the
<em>logos</em>. How this grasping is supposed to work is
tantalizingly obscure. </p>

<p>

Heraclitus regards the order of cosmos as like a language that can
be read or heard and understood by those who are attuned to it. 
That language is not just the physical evidence around us 
(&ldquo;Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to those with barbarian
souls&rdquo; B107); the sheer accumulation of information is not the
same as wisdom (see the rebuke in 22B40, quoted above). Although
the evidence of the senses is important (see B55 and other fragments on direct
experience vs. hearsay), careful and thoughtful inquiry is also
necessary. Those who are lovers of wisdom must be good inquirers
into many things (B35; also B101: &ldquo;I enquired into
myself&rdquo;), and must be able to grasp how the phenomena are signs
or evidence of the larger order; as Heraclitus notes in B123,
&ldquo;nature is accustomed to hide itself,&rdquo; and the evidence
must be carefully interpreted. That evidence is the interplay of
opposing states and forces, which Heraclitus points to by claims about
the unity of opposites and the roles of strife in human life as well as
in the cosmos. There are fragments that proclaim the unity or
identity of opposites: the road up and down are one and the same (B60),
the path of writing is both straight and crooked (B59), sea water is
very pure and very foul (B61). The famous river fragments (B49a,
B12, B91a) question the identity of things over time, while a number of
fragments point to the relativity of value judgments (B9, B82,
B102). Anaximander's system of just reciprocity ordered by
time is replaced by a system governed by war: &ldquo;It is right to
know that war is common and justice strife, and that all things come to
be through strife and are so ordained&rdquo; (B80). The changes
and alterations that constitute the processes of the cosmos are regular
and capable of being understood by one who can speak the language of
the <em>logos</em> and thus interpret properly. Although the
evidence is confusing, it points to the deeper regularities that
constitute the cosmos, just as Heraclitus' own remarks can seem
obscure yet point to the truth. Heraclitus surely has his own
message (and his delivery of it) in mind in B93, &ldquo;The lord whose
oracle is at Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives a
sign.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

One of the earliest of the Greek philosophers to discuss the human
soul, Heraclitus' claims about it, like his other views, are expressed
enigmatically.  Yet it seems fairly clear that he treats soul as the
seat of emotion, movement, and intellect.  B107 (quoted above)
indicates that understanding is a function of soul, and in B117, the
drunken man who must be led by a boy because he has lost control of
his legs, and also does not know where he goes or what he does.
Drunkenness is the cause of all this: because his soul has become wet
its powers are dampened down and become ineffective. B118 asserts
&ldquo;gleam of light: dry soul, wisest and best.&rdquo; This suggests
that for Heraclitus, soul is a stuff that is affected by changes along
the hot/cold and wet/dry continua.  Although Heraclitus says that it
is only divine nature that has complete understanding (B78), his
linking of fire with the <em>logos</em> and the divine, along with his
view that the best and wisest soul is hot and dry, suggests that
humans who care for their souls and search for the truth contained in
the <em>logos</em> can overcome human ignorance and approach
understanding. (Betegh 2007 and 2009, and Dilcher 1995 both discuss
the nature and importance of soul for Heraclitus; see also Granger
2000 and Kahn 1979.)</p>

<h2><a name="ParEle">4. Parmenides of Elea</a></h2>

<p>

Parmenides, born ca. 510 BCE in the Greek colony of Elea in southern
Italy (south of Naples, and now known as Velia), explores the nature
of philosophical inquiry, concentrating less on knowledge or
understanding (although he has views about these) than on what can be
understood. Xenophanes identified genuine knowledge with the grasping
of the sure and certain truth and claimed that &ldquo;no man has
seen&rdquo; it (21B34); Heraclitus had asserted that divine nature,
not human, has right understanding (22B78). Parmenides argues that
human thought can reach genuine knowledge or understanding, and that
there can be certain marks or signs that act as guarantees that the
goal of knowledge has been reached. A fundamental part of Parmenides'
claim is that what <em>must</em> be (cannot not-be, as Parmenides puts
it) is more knowable than what is merely contingent (what may or may
not be), which can be the object only of belief. </p>

<p>

Parmenides gives us a poem in Homeric hexameters, narrating the
journey of a young man (a <em>kouros</em>, in Greek) who is taken to
meet a goddess who promises to teach him &ldquo;all things&rdquo;
(28B1). The content of the story the goddess tells is not the
knowledge that will allow humans, by having it, to know. Rather,
the goddess gives the <em>kouros</em> the tools to acquire that
knowledge himself:</p>

<blockquote>

It is right that you learn all things,
<br />
Both the unshaking heart of well-persuasive truth,
<br />
and the beliefs of mortals, in which there is no true trust.
<br />
But nevertheless, you shall learn these things too, how it were right
that the things that seem be reliably, being indeed the whole of
things. (B1.28&ndash;32)

</blockquote>

<p>

The goddess does not provide a list of true propositions, as a body
of knowledge for him to acquire, and false ones to be avoided. 
Rather, in teaching the <em>kouros</em> how to evaluate claims about
what-is, the goddess gives him the power to know all, by testing and
evaluation, accepting or rejecting claims about the ultimate nature of
things&mdash;that being what, and all that, is capable of being
known. For Parmenides, the mark of what is known is that it is
something that genuinely is, with no taint of what-is-not. That
is why, for him, it not only is, but must be and cannot not-be. 
He sets this out in the key passages of B2 and
 B3:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<blockquote>

Come now, and I will tell you, and you, hearing, preserve the story,
<br />
the only routes of inquiry there are for thinking;
<br />
the one that it is and that it cannot not be
<br />
is the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon truth)
<br />
the other, that it is not and that it is right that it not be,
<br />
this I point out to you is a path wholly inscrutable
<br />
for you could not know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished)
<br />
nor could you point it out&hellip;  For the same thing is for thinking
and for being.

</blockquote>

<p>

The routes are methods of inquiry: keeping on the correct route will
bring one to what-is, the real object of thought and
understanding. Although what the goddess tells the
<em>kouros</em> has divine sanction (hers), that is not why he should
accept it. Rather, the truth she tells reveals a mark of its own
truth: it is testable by reason or thought itself. In B7 the
goddess warns that we must control our thought in the face of the
ever-present seductions of sense-experience:</p>

<blockquote>

For never shall this be forced through: that things that are not
are;
<br />
but restrain your thought from this route of inquiry,
<br />
nor let much-experienced habit force you along this path,
<br />
to ply an aimless eye and resounding ear
<br />
and tongue, but judge by thinking (<em>logos</em>) the much-battled testing
<br />
spoken by me. 

</blockquote>

<p>

The <em>kouros</em> himself can reach a decision or determination of
the truth solely through use of his <em>logos</em>. 
<em>Logos</em> here means thinking or reasoning. It is probably not reason as
a faculty that Parmenides intends here, but the reasoning aspect of
<em>noos</em>, the capacity for thought in general. In any case,
the test (restated at B8.15&ndash;16), is &ldquo;is or is not?&rdquo; &ndash;
this is not just the question of non-contradiction (which would give us
coherence), but whether or not the claim that something is entails, on
further examination, the actual reality of what-is-not. </p>

<p>

The arguments of B8 demonstrate <em>how</em> what-is must be, and in applying
these arguments as tests against any suggested basic entity in the
Presocratic search for ultimate causes or principles, the
<em>kouros</em> can determine whether or not a proposed theory is
acceptable. For Parmenides <em>noos</em> is not itself an
infallible capacity. One can think well or badly; correct
thinking is that which takes the correct route and so reaches
what-is. The mortals on the incorrect route are thinking, but
their thoughts have no real object  (none that is real in the
appropriate way), and so cannot be completed or perfected by reaching
the truth. In B8 Parmenides sets out the criteria for the being of what-is,
and then the arguments for those criteria:</p>

<blockquote>

&hellip; a single account still
<br />
remains of the route that it is;  and on this route there are
<br />
very many signs, that what-is is ungenerable and imperishable,
<br />
a whole of a single kind, and unshaking and complete;
<br />
nor was it nor will it be, since it is now all together
<br />
one, cohesive. (B8.1&ndash;6)

</blockquote>

<p>

 Any thing that genuinely is cannot be subject to coming-to-be or
passing-away, must be of a single nature, and must be complete, in the
sense of being unchangeably and unalterably what it is. These are
signs for what any ultimate cause or principle must be like, if it is
to be satisfactory as a principle, as something that can be known.
The signs are adverbial, showing how what-is is (Mourelatos 2008).
Only an entity which is in the complete way can be grasped and
understood in its entirety by thought. McKirahan (2008) provides a
thorough analysis of the arguments of B8, as does Palmer 2009.</p>

<p>
                 
After laying out the arguments about what-is, the goddess turns to the
route of mortals, in an account which she calls
&ldquo;deceptive.&rdquo;  Although Parmenides has been read as
thus rejecting any possibility of cosmological inquiry (Barnes 1979,
Owen 1960), there are persuasive interpretations that allow for
justified belief about the contingent world, a world that may or may
not be, and is not such that it must be (Nehamas 2002, Curd
2004, Palmer 2009). The problem of mortals is that they mistake what they
perceive for what there is (and must be). As long as one realizes
that the world of perception is not genuinely real, and cannot
therefore be the object of knowledge, it may be possible for there to
be justified belief about the cosmos.  Some details of
Parmenides' own cosmology are given, arguably as justified
belief, in the <em>Doxa</em> section of the poem, and more in the
testimonia from later authors. Parmenides marks a sharp
distinction between being (what-is and must be) and becoming, and
between knowledge and perception-based belief or opinion.</p>

<h2><a name="PytTra">5. The Pythagorean Tradition</a></h2>

<p>

In the last quarter of the sixth century, before Parmenides' birth,
Pythagoras of Samos (an Aegean island) arrived in Croton, in southern
Italy. He established a community of followers who adopted his
political views, which favored rule by the &ldquo;better
people,&rdquo; and also the way of life he recommended on what seem to
have been more or less philosophical bases. The traditional view has
been that the aristocracy, the &ldquo;better people,&rdquo; generally
meant the rich. But Burkert notes that as early as the 4<sup>th</sup>
c. BCE there were two traditions about Pythagoras, one that meshes
with the traditional view and associates Pythagoras with political
tyrants, and another that credits him with rejecting tyrannies for
aristocracies that might not have been grounded in wealth (Burkert
1972, 119). The Pythagorean Archytas (born late 5<sup>th</sup>
century) lived in a democracy (Tarentum in southern Italy), and seems
to have argued for fair and proportionate dealings between rich and
poor (Huffman 2005). The Pythagorean way of life included adherence to
certain prescriptions including religious rites and dietary
restrictions (see the general discussion in Kahn 2001). </p>

<p>

Like Socrates, Pythagoras wrote nothing himself, but had a great
influence on those who followed him. He had a reputation for great
learning and wisdom (see Empedocles 31B129), although he was treated
satirically by both Xenophanes (21B7) and Heraclitus (22B40, B129). We
do not know to what extent this included knowledge of mathematics, as
would be suggested by the attribution to him of the famous Pythagorean
theorem of geometry. The details of Pythagoras' views are unclear, but
he seems to have advocated the immortality of the soul (a novel idea
among the Greeks, also developed in Orphic religion) and the
possibility of the transmigration of the human soul after death into
other animal forms.  Pythagorean writers after his own time stressed
the mathematical structure and order of the universe.  This is often
attributed directly to Pythagoras (primarily because of the
geometrical theorem that bears his name), but recent scholarship has
shown that the evidence for attributing this mathematically-based
cosmology to Pythagoras himself is convoluted and doubtful (Burkert
1972, Huffman 1993 and 2005; but see Zhmud 1997). </p>

<p>

What seems clear is that the early Pythagoreans conceived of nature
as a structured system ordered by number (see the SEP entry on
Pythagoras), and that such post-Parmenidean Pythagoreans as Philolaus
(last half of the 5<sup>th</sup> century, more than a generation after
Pythagoras' death) and Archytas (late 5<sup>th</sup> to early
4<sup>th</sup> century) held more complicated views about the relation
between mathematics and cosmology than it is reasonable to suppose
Pythagoras himself could have advanced. The Pythagorean tradition
thus includes two strains. There are reports of a split in the
period after Pythagoras' death between what we would term the
more philosophically inclined Pythagoreans and others who primarily
adopted the Pythagorean ethical, religious and political
attitudes. The latter, called the <em>acusmatici</em>, followed
the Pythagorean precepts, or <em>acusmata</em> (which means
&ldquo;things heard&rdquo;). The former, the philosophical
Pythagoreans (including Philolaus and Archytas), were the called
<em>mathematici</em>, and while they recognized that the
<em>acusmatici</em> were indeed Pythagoreans by virtue of accepting
Pythagorean precepts, they claimed that they themselves were the true
followers of Pythagoras.</p>

<p>
                 
Philolaus of Croton seems to have blended the Pythagorean life with an
awareness of and appreciation for the arguments of Parmenides (Huffman
1993). According to Philolaus, &ldquo;Nature in the cosmos was
fitted together out of unlimiteds and limiters&rdquo; (44B1). 
These limiters and unlimiteds play the role of Parmenidean basic
realities&mdash;they are and unchangingly must be what they are, and
so can be known; they are joined together in a harmonia (literally, a
carpenter's joint; metaphorically, a harmony), and &ldquo;it was
not possible for any of the things that are and are known by us to come
to be, without the existence of the being of things from which the
cosmos was put together&rdquo; (44B6). The unlimiteds are
unstructured stuffs and continua; the limiters impose structure (shape,
form, mathematical structure) on the unlimiteds. Things become
knowable because they are structured in this way; the structure can
apparently be expressed in a numerical ratio that allows for
understanding: &ldquo;All things that are known have number; for
without this nothing whatever could possibly be thought of or
known&rdquo; (44B4).</p>

<h2><a name="OthEleZenMel">6. Other Eleatics: Zeno and Melissus</a></h2>

<p>

Parmenides had argued that there were strict metaphysical requirements
on any object of knowledge; the later Eleatics, Zeno of Elea (born
ca. 490) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440), extended and explored
the consequences of his arguments. Zeno paid particular attention to
the contrast between the requirements of logical argument and the
evidence of the senses (Vlastos 1967 is a masterly treatment of Zeno;
see also McKirahan 1999 and 2005). The four famous paradoxes of
motion, for which he is now and in antiquity best known, purported to
show that, despite the evidence all around us, the ordinary motion of
everyday life is impossible. The paradoxes claim that motions can
never be begun (the Achilles) or be completed (the Dichotomy), entail
contradictions (the Moving Blocks), or are altogether impossible (the
 Arrow).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup> 
 Recent
philosophers of space and time (see Gr&uuml;nbaum 1967, articles in
Salmon 2001, Huggett 1999) hold that the arguments are reductios of
the theses that space and time are continuous (the Achilles and the
Dichotomy) or discrete (the Moving Blocks and the Arrow). 
Consider the Dichotomy: a runner can never complete a run from point A
to point B. First, the runner must move from A to a point halfway
between A and B (call it C). But between A and C there is yet
another halfway point (D), and the runner must first reach D. But
between A and D there is yet another halfway point &hellip; and so on,
ad infinitum. So the runner, starting at A, can never reach
B. The argument assumes that it is impossible to pass an infinite
number of points in a finite time. Similarly, Zeno produced
paradoxes showing that plurality is impossible: if things are
many, contradictions follow (Plato's <em>Parmenides</em>
127e1ff.; Zeno in 29B1, 29B2, and 29B3); there were also purported
proofs that place is impossible (29A24) and that things cannot have
parts (the Millet Seed, 29A29).</p>

<p>

Melissus, dismissed as a simple-minded thinker by Aristotle (and by
some contemporary scholars as well), expands Parmenides' arguments
about the nature of what-is. It is Melissus who explicitly claims that
only one thing can be: if what-is is unlimited (as he thinks it is),
it must be one and all alike (if there were two [in number or in
character] they would be &ldquo;limited against each other&rdquo;
30B6). Melissus specifically argues against the empty (the void), and
rejects the possibility of rearrangement (which would allow for the
appearance of coming-to-be and passing-away)&mdash;all these
characteristics are incompatible with the unity of what-is. Melissus
thus claims that what is real is completely unlike the world that we
experience: the split between appearance and reality is complete and
unbridgeable.</p>

<h2><a name="PluAnaClaEmpAcr">7. The Pluralists: Anaxagoras of Clazomenae and Empedocles of Acragas</a></h2>

<p>

While Zeno and Melissus reinforced Parmenides' distinction
between what-is (i.e., what must be) and what appears, other post-Parmenidean thinkers
accepted Parmenides' arguments against coming-to-be and
passing-away (as characterizing what-is), and about the nature of what
is ultimately real, and argued that they did not rule out the
possibility of metaphysically-based (or rational) cosmology. Both
Anaxagoras and Empedocles worked within the Parmenidean pattern while
developing distinct cosmological systems that addressed their own
particular concerns (especially in the case of Empedocles, concerns
about the proper way to live).  </p>

<p>
                 
Anaxagoras (writing in the mid-5<sup>th</sup> c.) claims, &ldquo;The
Greeks [i.e., ordinary people] do not think correctly about
coming-to-be and passing-away; for no thing comes to be or passes away,
but is mixed together and dissociated from the things that are. 
And thus they would be correct to call coming-to-be mixing-together and
passing-away dissociating&rdquo; (59B17). What seem to be
generated objects (human beings, plants, animals, the moon, the stars)
are instead temporary mixtures of ingredients (such as earth, air,
fire, water, hair, flesh, blood, dense, dark, rare, bright, and
 so
 on).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup> 
 The
original state was one of universal mixture: &ldquo;All things were
together, unlimited both in amount and in smallness, for the small,
too, was unlimited. And because all things were together, nothing
was evident&rdquo; (59B1). This mixture is set into rotary motion
by the operation of Mind (<em>Nous</em> &ndash; B12, B13, B14; see
discussions in Laks 1993, Lesher 1995, Menn 1995, Curd 2007), a
separate cosmic entity that does not share in such mixture. As
the rotation spreads out through the unlimited mass of
indistinguishably intermingled ingredients, the rotation causes a
winnowing or separating effect, and the cosmos as we know it emerges
from the mixture. Moreover, not only <em>were</em> all things
together, they are <em>even now</em> all together, in a different way,
despite the differentiations now achieved. Everything is in
everything (59B5, B6, B11), in some proportions, however small or great
&ndash; this is a move to prevent even the appearance of coming-to-be
from what-is-not. </p>

<p>

Anaxagoras marks an important theoretical step in attributing the
motion of his ingredients to an external, independent, intelligent
force (although both Plato and Aristotle were disappointed that his
theory was not properly&mdash;from their point of
view&mdash;teleological; on this see Sedley 2007).  The rotation is
ultimately causally responsible for the formation of the heavens and
the activities of the great masses of the earth and the water on the
earth, as well as all meteorological phenomena.  Insofar as the causes
of the operations of the heavens and the phenomena apparent to us from
day to day are the same at both the macro- and micro-level (the
rotations that cause the apparent motions of the stars are the same as
those that govern the cycles of weather and life and death on earth),
we can infer the nature of what is real from what is
apparent. Although we do not perceive all things as being together,
and the move to the ultimate explanations is an inference, it is a
legitimate one (&ldquo;owing to their [the senses&rsquo;] feebleness,
we are not able to determine the truth&rdquo; yet &ldquo;appearances
are a sight of the unseen&rdquo; 59B21 and 21a).</p>

<p>
                 
A younger contemporary of Anaxagoras, Empedocles, who lived in Sicily,
also recognized the force of Parmenides' arguments against
coming-to-be and passing-away. (Empedocles also adopts Parmenides'
poetic meter in order to tell his story.)  Empedocles proposes a
cosmos formed of the four roots (as he calls them), earth, water, air,
and fire along with the motive forces of Love and Strife.  Love unites
opposed (unlike) things, mixing unlikes, while Strife sets unlikes in
opposition and pulls them apart, with the effect that it mixes like
with like.  Just as painters can produce fantastically lifelike scenes
just by mixing colors, so the operations of Love and Strife, using
just the four roots can produce &ldquo;trees and men and women, and
beasts and birds and water-nourished fish, and long-lived gods best in
honors&rdquo; (31B17). These are the things that Empedocles calls
&ldquo;mortal,&rdquo; and he even provides recipes. 31B73 tells how
Kypris (the goddess Aphrodite, i.e. love) fashions shapes (or kinds):
&ldquo;she moistened earth in rain, and gave it to quick fire to
harden.&rdquo; B96 gives a recipe for bones, while in B98 flesh and
blood have the same recipe (earth, water, air, and fire in equal
proportions), but differ in the refinement of the mixture. </p>

<p>

Like the other Presocratics, Empedocles has a cosmological theory,
in his case, an unending cycle involving the competition between Love
and Strife.  Love overcomes the separating influence of Strife,
bringing together unlikes and so preventing the clinging together of
likes. The triumph of Love results in the Sphere, which is a
complete mixture because the four unlike roots are as mixed
(integrated) as possible. Strife breaks up the sphere by
beginning to attract like to like and so pulling the mixture apart,
until, when it triumphs, there is complete segregation of the
roots. Love resists the separation of unlikes and the clinging
together of likes, by trying to keep unlike things mixed. The
cosmos as we know it is a result of intermediate phases between the two
extremes of the triumph of one of the
 forces.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup> </p>

<p>
                 
Although Empedocles has a cosmic story to tell, cosmology is not his
sole interest. Like the Pythagoreans, Empedocles thought that how
one lived was as important as one's theoretical commitments (and
that the two were intimately connected). The ancient evidence
seems to suggest that Empedocles was the author of two works, commonly
called in modern scholarship the <em>Physics</em> and the
<em>Purifications</em>, one cosmological and the other
ethico-religious. The relation between the two works has been a
matter of some controversy. In the 1990s new evidence from the
Strasbourg Papyrus showed unequivocally that the cosmological and
ethico-religious aspects of Empedocles' thought are inextricably
intertwined (Martin and Primavesi 1999, Primavesi 2008, Kingsley
1995), although commentators still disagree about whether this new
evidence supports the conclusion that there was a single poem
combining
 both.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup> 
 The correct philosophical understanding of the physical world and the
correct way to live cannot be separated from one another in
Empedocles' thought (a similar attitude appears in Heraclitus); one
cannot fully understand the world without living
 correctly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup> 
 Like the Pythagoreans, the Empedoclean
way of life included vegetarianism and a story of transmigrating
<em>daim&#333;ns</em> who seem to have some kind of personal
identity.</p>

<h2><a name="PreAto">8. Presocratic Atomism</a></h2>

<p>

The pluralism of Anaxagoras and Empedocles maintained the Eleatic
strictures on metaphysically acceptable basic entities (things that are
and must be just what they are) by adopting an irreducible pluralism of
stuffs meeting these standards that could pass on their qualities to
items constructed from them. Ancient atomism responded more
radically: what is real is an infinite number of solid, uncuttable
(<em>atomon</em>) units of matter. All atoms are made of the same
stuff (solid matter, in itself otherwise indeterminate), differing from
one another (according to Aristotle) only in shape, position,
arrangement. (Later sources say that atoms differ in weight; this
is certainly true for post-Aristotelian atomism, but less likely for
Presocratic atomism.)  In addition, the Presocratic atomists,
Leucippus and Democritus (Democritus was born in about 460 BCE in Abdera
in Northern Greece, shortly after Socrates was born in Athens),
enthusiastically endorsed the reality of the empty (or
 void).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup> 
 The void
is what separates atoms and allows for the differences noted above
(except weight, which could not be accounted for by void, since void in
an atom would make it divisible and, hence, not an atom) (Sedley
1982; see also Sedley 2008). </p>

<p>

Like Anaxagoras, the atomists consider all phenomenal objects and
characteristics as emerging from the background mixture; in the case of
atomism, the mix of atoms and void (Wardy 1988). Everything is
constructed of atoms and void: the shapes of the atoms and their
arrangement with respect to each other (and the intervening void) give
physical objects their apparent characteristics. As Democritus says:
&ldquo;By convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot,
by convention cold, by convention color: in reality atoms and
void&rdquo; (68B125 = B9). For example, Theophrastus says that
the flavors differ according to the shapes of the atoms that compose
various objects; thus &ldquo;Democritus makes sweet that which is round
and quite large, astringent that which large, rough, polygonal and not
rounded&rdquo; (<em>de Caus. Plant</em>. 6.1.6 = 68A129). 
Simplicius reports that things composed of sharp and very fine atoms in
similar positions are hot and fiery; those composed of atoms with the
opposite character come to be cold and watery (<em>in Phys.</em> 36.3&ndash;6
= 67A14). Moreover, Theophrastus reports that the atomists
explain why iron is harder than lead but lighter; it is harder because
of the uneven arrangements of the atoms that make it up, lighter
because it contains more void than lead. Lead, on the other hand,
has less void than iron, but the even arrangement of the atoms makes
lead easier to cut or to bend.  </p>

<p>

Adopting a strong distinction between appearance and reality, and
denying the accuracy of appearances, as we see him do in the above
quotation, Democritus was seen by some ancient sources (especially
Sextus Empiricus) as a sort of skeptic, yet the evidence is
unclear. It is true that Democritus is quoted as saying, &ldquo;In
truth we know nothing; for truth is in the depths&rdquo;
(68B117). So for him, the truth is not given in the
appearances. Yet, even Sextus seems to agree that Democritus
allows for knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>

But in the <em>Rules</em> [Democritus] says that there are two kinds
of knowing, one through the senses and the other through the
understanding. The one through the understanding he calls
genuine, witnessing to its trustworthiness in deciding truth; the one
through the senses he names bastard, denying it steadfastness in the
discernment of what is true. He says in these words, &ldquo;There
are two forms of knowing, one genuine and the other bastard. To
the bastard belong all these: sight, hearing, smell, taste,
touch. The other, the genuine, has been separated from
this&rdquo; [68B11]. Then preferring the genuine to the bastard,
he continues, saying, &ldquo;Whenever the bastard is no longer able to
see more finely nor hear nor smell nor taste nor perceive by touch, but
something finer&hellip;&rdquo;

</blockquote>

<p>

Thus Sextus suggests that the evidence of the senses, when properly
interpreted by reason, can be taken as a guide to reality (the claim
that &ldquo;appearances are a sight of the unseen&rdquo; is attributed
to Democritus as well as to Anaxagoras). We just need to know how
to follow this guide, through proper reasoning, so as to reach the
truth&mdash;i.e., the theory of atoms and void (Lee 2005).</p>

<p>

In addition to fragments advancing these metaphysical and physical
doctrines, there are a number of ethical fragments attributed to
Democritus (but the question of authenticity looms large here);
although a passage reported in John Stobaeus seems to link moderation
and cheerfulness with small measured movements in the soul and says
that excess and deficiencies give rise to large movements (68B191), it
is unclear whether or how these claims are directly related to the
metaphysical aspects of atomism (Vlastos 1945 and 1946, Kahn
1985b). Democritus was identified in antiquity with the idea of
&ldquo;good cheer&rdquo; (<em>euthumi&#275;</em>) as the proper guiding
objective in living one's life. In this, as in other
aspects of his philosophy, he may have had some influence on the
formation of Epicurus' philosophy a century later.</p>

<h2><a name="DioApoSop">9. Diogenes of Apollonia and the Sophists</a></h2>

<p>

In the last part of the 5<sup>th</sup> century, Diogenes of Apollonia
(active after 440 BCE) revived and revised the Milesian system of
cosmology, claiming that &ldquo;all the things that are are
alterations from the same thing and are the same thing&rdquo; (64B2);
he identified this single basic substance with air, like Anaximenes
more than a century before (Graham 2006, Laks 2008, 2008a). Yet
Diogenes takes care to give arguments for the existence and properties
of his basic principle. In B2 he says that only things that are alike
can affect one another. If there were a plurality of basic substances,
each differing in what Diogenes calls their &ldquo;own proper
nature,&rdquo; there could be no interaction between them. Yet the
evidence of the senses is clear: things mix and separate and interact
with one another.  Thus, all things must be forms of some one single
thing. Like Anaxagoras, Diogenes claims that the cosmic system is
ordered by intelligence, and he argues that that &ldquo;which
possesses intelligence (<em>no&#275;sis</em>) is what human beings
call air&rdquo; (B5). Humans and animals live by breathing air, and
are governed by it &mdash;in them air is both soul and intelligence,
or mind (B4). Moreover, Diogenes argues, air governs and rules all
things and is god (B5). Thus, like Anaxagoras, Diogenes has a theory
grounded in intelligence, although Diogenes is more fully committed to
teleological explanations, insofar as he states explicitly that
intelligence (<em>no&#275;sis</em>) orders things in a good way
(B3). In presenting his arguments, Diogenes fulfills his own
requirement for a philosophical claim. In B1 he says, &ldquo;In my
opinion, anyone beginning a <em>logos</em> (account) ought to present
a starting principle (<em>arch&#275;</em>) that is indisputable and a
style that is simple and stately.&rdquo; He notes that his theory that
air is soul and intelligence &ldquo;will have been made clearly
evident in this book&rdquo; (B4). </p>

<p>
                 
Theophrastus says that Diogenes was the last of the physical
philosophers, the <em>physiologoi</em>, or &ldquo;inquirers into
nature,&rdquo; as Aristotle called them. There was also another
group of thinkers active about this time: the Sophists. Many of
our views about this group have been shaped by Plato's
aggressively negative assessment of them: in his dialogues Plato
expressly contrasts the genuine philosopher, i.e., Socrates, with the
Sophists, especially in their role as teachers of young men growing
into their maturity (youths at the age when Socrates, too, engaged with
them in his discussions). Modern scholarship (Woodruff and
Gagarin 2008, Kerferd 1981, Guthrie 1969) has shown the
diversity of their views. They were not completely uninterested
in the theoretical problems that concerned others of the
Presocratics. Gorgias of Leontini explored the possibility of the
sort of theoretical knowledge that Parmenides explored: in his <em>On
Nature</em>, or <em>On what-is-not</em>, Gorgias claims that nothing
satisfies Parmenides' requirements for what-is (Mansfeld 1985,
Mourelatos 1987b, Palmer 1999, Caston 2002, Curd 2006). 
Protagoras, too, questioned the possibility of the sort of objective
knowledge that the Presocratics sought. The Sophists explored
ethical and political questions: Does law or convention ground what is
right, or is it a matter of nature?  They were peripatetic,
sometimes serving as diplomats, and they were both entertainers and
teachers. They gave public displays of rhetoric (this contrasts
with Diogenes of Apollonia's comments about his book, which seems
to imply a more private
 enterprise)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 and took on students, teaching both the art of rhetoric and the
skills necessary for succeeding in Greek political life. With the
Sophists, as with Socrates, interest in ethics and political thought
becomes a more prominent aspect of Greek philosophy.</p>

<h2><a name="PreLeg">10. The Presocratic Legacy</a></h2>

<p>

The range of Presocratic thought shows that the first philosophers were
not merely physicists (although they were certainly that). Their
interests extended to religious and ethical thought, the nature of
understanding, mathematics, meteorology, the nature of explanation, and
the roles of mechanism, matter, form, and structure in the world. 
Almost all the Presocratics seemed to have something to say about
embryology, and fragments of Diogenes and Empedocles show a keen
interest in the structures of the body; the overlap between ancient
philosophy and ancient medicine is of growing interest to scholars of
early Greek thought (Longrigg 1963, van der Eijk 2008). 
Recent discoveries, such as the Derveni Papyrus (Betegh 2004,
Kouremenos et al. 2006, Janko 2001, Laks and Most 1997), show that
interest in and knowledge of the early philosophers was not necessarily
limited to a small audience of rationalistic intellectuals. They
passed on many of what later became the basic concerns of philosophy to
Plato and Aristotle, and ultimately to the whole tradition of Western
philosophical thought.</p>
