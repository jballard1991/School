        <font face="Bookman Old Style">1. There are some philosophers, who
        imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call our
        SELF; that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence; and
        are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect
        identity and simplicity. The strongest sensation, the most violent
        passion, say they, instead of distracting us from this view, only fix it
        the more intensely, and make us consider their influence on <i>self</i>
        either by their pain or pleasure. To attempt a farther proof of this
        were to weaken its evidence; since no proof can be deriv'd from any
        fact, of which we are so intimately conscious; nor is there any thing,
        of which we can be certain, if we doubt of this.&nbsp;</font>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">2. Unluckily all these positive
        assertions are contrary to that very experience, which is pleaded for
        them, nor have we any idea of <i>self</i>, after the manner it is here
        explain'd. For from what impression cou'd this idea be deriv'd? This
        question 'tis impossible to answer without a manifest contradiction and
        absurdity; and yet 'tis a question, which must necessarily be answer'd,
        if we wou'd have the idea of self pass for clear and intelligible. It
        must be some one impression, that gives rise to every real idea. But
        self or person is not any one impression, but that to which our several
        impressions and ideas are suppos'd to have a reference. If any
        impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must continue
        invariably the same, thro' the whole course of our lives; since self is
        suppos'd to exist after that manner. But there is no impression constant
        and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and
        sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time. It
        cannot, therefore, be from any of these impressions, or from any other,
        that the idea of self is deriv'd; and consequently there is no such
        idea.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">3. But farther, what must become of
        all our particular perceptions upon this hypothesis? All these are
        different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other, and may
        be separately consider'd, and may exist separately, and have no need of
        any thing to support their existence. After what manner, therefore, do
        they belong to self; and how are they connected with it? For my part,
        when I enter most intimately into what I call <i>myself</i>, I always
        stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light
        or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch <i>myself</i>
        at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but
        the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by
        sound sleep; so long am I insensible of <i>myself</i>, and may truly be
        said not to exist. And were all my perceptions remov'd by death, and
        cou'd I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after the
        dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely annihilated, nor do I
        conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If
        any one, upon serious and unprejudic'd reflection thinks he has a
        different notion of <i>himself</i>, I must confess I can reason no
        longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as
        well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He
        may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continu'd, which he calls <i>himself</i>;
        tho' I am certain there is no such principle in me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">4. But setting aside some
        metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture to affirm of the rest of
        mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different
        perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity,
        and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their
        sockets without varying our perceptions. Our thought is still more
        variable than our sight; and all our other senses and faculties
        contribute to this change; nor is there any single power of the soul,
        which remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment. The mind is
        a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their
        appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety
        of postures and situations. There is properly no <i>simplicity</i> in it
        at one time, nor <i>identity</i> in different; whatever natural
        propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity. The
        comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the successive
        perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant
        notion of the place, where these scenes are represented, or of the
        materials, of which it is compos'd.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">5. What then gives us so great a
        propension to ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and
        to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and uninterrupted
        existence thro' the whole course of our lives? In order to answer this
        question, we must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as it regards
        our thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the
        concern we take in ourselves. The first is our present subject; and to
        explain it perfectly we must take the matter pretty deep, and account
        for that identity, which we attribute to plants and animals; there being
        a great analogy betwixt it, and the identity of a self or person.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">6. We have a distinct idea of an
        object, that remains invariable and uninterrupted thro' a suppos'd
        variation of time; and this idea we call that of <i>identity</i> or <i>sameness</i>.
        We have also a distinct idea of several different objects existing in
        succession, and connected together by a close relation; and this to an
        accurate view affords as perfect a notion of <i>diversity</i>, as if
        there was no manner of relation among the objects. But tho' these two
        ideas of identity, and a succession of related objects be in themselves
        perfectly distinct, and even contrary, yet 'tis certain, that in our
        common way of thinking they are generally confounded with each other.
        That action of the imagination, by which we consider the uninterrupted
        and invariable object, and that by which we reflect on the succession of
        related objects, are almost the same to the feeling, nor is there much
        more effort of thought requir'd in the latter case than in the former.
        The relation facilitates the transition of the mind from one object to
        another, and renders its passage as smooth as if it contemplated one
        continu'd object. This resemblance is the cause of the confusion and
        mistake, and makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead of that
        of related objects. However at one instant we may consider the related
        succession as variable or interrupted, we are sure the next to ascribe
        to it a perfect identity, and regard it as enviable and uninterrupted.
        Our propensity to this mistake is so great from the resemblance above-mention'd,
        that we fall into it before we are aware; and tho' we incessantly
        correct ourselves by reflection, and return to a more accurate method of
        thinking, yet we cannot long sustain our philosophy, or take off this
        biass from the imagination. Our last resource is to yield to it, and
        boldly assert that these different related objects are in effect the
        same, however interrupted and variable. In order to justify to ourselves
        this absurdity, we often feign some new and unintelligible principle,
        that connects the objects together, and prevents their interruption or
        variation. Thus we feign the continu'd existence of the perceptions of
        our senses, to remove the interruption: and run into the notion of a <i>soul</i>,
        and <i>self</i>, and <i>substance</i>, to disguise the variation. But we
        may farther observe, that where we do not give rise to such a fiction,
        our propension to confound identity with relation is so great, that we
        are apt to imagine <a href="#1">[1]</a> something unknown and
        mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their relation; and this I take
        to be the case with regard to the identity we ascribe to plants and
        vegetables. And even when this does not take place, we still feel a
        propensity to confound these ideas, tho' we are not able fully to
        satisfy ourselves in that particular, nor find any thing invariable and
        uninterrupted to justify our notion of identity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">7. Thus the controversy concerning
        identity is not merely a dispute of words. For when we attribute
        identity, in an improper sense, to variable or interrupted objects, our
        mistake is not confin'd to the expression, but is commonly attended with
        a fiction, either of something invariable and uninterrupted, or of
        something mysterious and inexplicable, or at least with a propensity to
        such fictions. What will suffice to prove this hypothesis to the
        satisfaction of every fair enquirer, is to shew from daily experience
        and observation, that the objects, which are variable or interrupted,
        and yet are suppos'd to continue the same, are such only as consist of a
        succession of parts, connected together by resemblance, contiguity, or
        causation. For as such a succession answers evidently to our notion of
        diversity, it can only be by mistake we ascribe to it an identity; and
        as the relation of parts, which leads us into this mistake, is really
        nothing but a quality, which produces an association of ideas, and an
        easy transition of the imagination from one to another, it can only be
        from the resemblance, which this act of the mind bears to that, by which
        we contemplate one continu'd object, that the error arises. Our chief
        business, then, must be to prove, that all objects, to which we ascribe
        identity, without observing their invariableness and uninterruptedness,
        are such as consist of a succession of related objects.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">8. In order to this, suppose any mass
        of matter, of which the parts are contiguous and connected, to be plac'd
        before us; 'tis plain we must attribute a perfect identity to this mass,
        provided all the parts continue uninterruptedly and invariably the same,
        whatever motion or change of place we may observe either in the whole or
        in any of the parts. But supposing some very <i>small</i> or <i>inconsiderable</i>
        part to be added to the mass, or subtracted from it; tho' this
        absolutely destroys the identity of the whole, strictly speaking; yet as
        we seldom think so accurately, we scruple not to pronounce a mass of
        matter the same, where we find so trivial an alteration. The passage of
        the thought from the object before the change to the object after it, is
        so smooth and easy, that we scarce perceive the transition, and are apt
        to imagine, that 'tis nothing but a continu'd survey of the same object.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">9. There is a very remarkable
        circumstance, that attends this experiment; which is, that tho' the
        change of any considerable part in a mass of matter destroys the
        identity of the whole, let we must measure the greatness of the part,
        not absolutely, but by its <i>proportion</i> to the whole. The addition
        or diminution of a mountain wou'd not be sufficient to produce a
        diversity in a planet: tho' the change of a very few inches wou'd be
        able to destroy the identity of some bodies. 'Twill be impossible to
        account for this, but by reflecting that objects operate upon the mind,
        and break or interrupt the continuity of its actions not according to
        their real greatness, but according to their proportion to each other:
        And therefore, since this interruption makes an object cease to appear
        the same, it must be the uninterrupted progress o the thought, which
        constitutes the imperfect identity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">10. This may be confirm'd by another
        phenomenon. A change in any considerable part of a body destroys its
        identity; but 'tis remarkable, that where the change is produc'd <i>gradually</i>
        and <i>insensibl</i>y we are less apt to ascribe to it the same effect.
        The reason can plainly be no other, than that the mind, in following the
        successive changes of the body, feels an easy passage from the surveying
        its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another, and at no
        particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. From which
        continu'd perception, it ascribes a continu'd existence and identity to
        the object.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">11. But whatever precaution we may use
        in introducing the changes gradually, and making them proportionable to
        the whole, 'tis certain, that where the changes are at last observ'd to
        become considerable, we make a scruple of ascribing identity to such
        different objects. There is, however, another artifice, by which we may
        induce the imagination to advance a step farther; and that is, by
        producing a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination to
        some <i>common end</i> or purpose. A ship, of which a considerable part
        has been chang'd by frequent reparations, is still considered as the
        same; nor does the difference of the materials hinder us from ascribing
        an identity to it. The common end, in which the parts conspire, is the
        same under all their variations, and affords an easy transition of the
        imagination from one situation of the body to another.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">12. But this is still more remarkable,
        when we add a <i>sympathy</i> of parts to their <i>common end</i>, and
        suppose that they bear to each other, the reciprocal relation of cause
        and effect in all their actions and operations. This is the case with
        all animals and vegetables; where not only the several parts have a
        reference to some general purpose, but also a mutual dependence on, and
        connexion with each other. The effect of so strong a relation is, that
        tho' every one must allow, that in a very few years both vegetables and
        animals endure a <i>total</i> change, yet we still attribute identity to
        them, while their form, size, and substance are entirely alter'd. An
        oak, that grows from a small plant to a large tree, is still the same
        oak; tho' there be not one particle of matter, or figure of its parts
        the same. An infant becomes a man, and is sometimes fat, sometimes lean,
        without any change in his identity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">13. We may also consider the two
        following phaenomena, which are remarkable in their kind. The first is,
        that tho' we commonly be able to distinguish pretty exactly betwixt
        numerical and specific identity, yet it sometimes happens, that we
        confound them, and in our thinking and reasoning employ the one for the
        other. Thus a man, who hears a noise, that is frequently interrupted and
        renew'd, says, it is still the same noise; tho' 'tis evident the sounds
        have only a specific identity or resemblance, and there is nothing
        numerically the same, but the cause, which produc'd them. In like manner
        it may be said without breach of the propriety of language, that such a
        church, which was formerly of brick, fell to ruin, and that the parish
        rebuilt the same church of free-stone, and according to modern
        architecture. Here neither the form nor materials are the same, nor is
        there any thing common to the two objects, but their relation to the
        inhabitants of the parish; and yet this alone is sufficient to make us
        denominate them the same. But we must observe, that in these cases the
        first object is in a manner annihilated before the second comes into
        existence; by which means, we are never presented in any one point of
        time with the idea of difference and multiplicity: and for that reason
        are less scrupulous in calling them the same.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">14. Secondly, We may remark, that tho'
        in a succession of related objects, it be in a manner requisite, that
        the change of parts be not sudden nor entire, in order to preserve the
        identity, yet where the objects are in their nature changeable and
        inconstant, we admit of a more sudden transition, than wou'd otherwise
        be consistent with that relation. Thus as the nature of a river consists
        in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty
        hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from
        continuing the same during several ages. What is natural and essential
        to any thing is, in a manner, expected; and what is expected makes less
        impression, and appears of less moment, than what is unusual and
        extraordinary. A considerable change of the former kind seems really
        less to the imagination, than the most trivial alteration of the latter;
        and by breaking less the continuity of the thought, has less influence
        in destroying the identity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">15. We now proceed to explain the
        nature of <i>personal identity</i>, which has become so great a question
        in philosophy, especially of late years in <i>England</i>, where all the
        abstruser sciences are study'd with a peculiar ardour and application.
        And here 'tis evident, the same method of reasoning must be continu'd.
        which has so successfully explain'd the identity of plants, and animals,
        and ships, and houses, and of all the compounded and changeable
        productions either of art or nature. The identity, which we ascribe to
        the mind of man, is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that
        which we ascribe to vegetables and animal bodies. It cannot, therefore,
        have a different origin, but must proceed from a like operation of the
        imagination upon like objects.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">16. But lest this argument shou'd not
        convince the reader; tho' in my opinion perfectly decisive; let him
        weigh the following reasoning, which is still closer and more immediate.
        'Tis evident, that the identity, which we attribute to the human mind,
        however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not able to run the several
        different perceptions into one, and make them lose their characters of
        distinction and difference, which are essential to them. 'Tis still
        true, that every distinct perception, which enters into the composition
        of the mind, is a distinct existence, and is different, and
        distinguishable, and separable from every other perception, either
        contemporary or successive. But, as, notwithstanding this distinction
        and separability, we suppose the whole train of perceptions to be united
        by identity, a question naturally arises concerning this relation of
        identity; whether it be something that really binds our several
        perceptions together, or only associates their ideas in the imagination.
        That is, in other words, whether in pronouncing concerning the identity
        of a person, we observe some real bond among his perceptions, or only
        feel one among the ideas we form of them. This question we might easily
        decide, if we wou'd recollect what has been already prov'd at large,
        that the understanding never observes any real connexion among objects,
        and that even the union of cause and effect, when strictly examin'd,
        resolves itself into a customary association of ideas. For from thence
        it evidently follows, that identity is nothing really belonging to these
        different perceptions, and uniting them together; but is merely a
        quality, which we attribute to them, because of the union of their ideas
        in the imagination, when we reflect upon them. Now the only qualities,
        which can give ideas an union in the imagination, are these three
        relations above-mention'd. These are the uniting principles in the ideal
        world, and without them every distinct object is separable by the mind,
        and may be separately considered, and appears not to have any more
        connexion with any other object, than if disjoin'd by the greatest
        difference and remoteness. 'Tis, therefore, on some of these three
        relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation, that identity
        depends; and as the very essence of these relations consists in their
        producing an easy transition of ideas; it follows, that our notions of
        personal identity, proceed entirely from the smooth and uninterrupted
        progress of the thought along a train of connected ideas, according to
        the principles above-explain'd.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">17. The only question, therefore,
        which remains, is, by what relations this uninterrupted progress of our
        thought is produc'd, when we consider the successive existence of a mind
        or thinking person. And here 'tis evident we must confine ourselves to
        resemblance and causation, and must drop contiguity, which has little or
        no influence in the present case.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">18. To begin with <i>resemblance</i>;
        suppose we cou'd see clearly into the breast of another, and observe
        that succession of perceptions, which constitutes his mind or thinking
        principle, and suppose that he always preserves the memory of a
        considerable part of past perceptions; 'tis evident that nothing cou'd
        more contribute to the bestowing a relation on this succession amidst
        all its variations. For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we
        raise up the images of past perceptions? And as an image necessarily
        resembles its object, must not the frequent placing of these resembling
        perceptions in the chain of thought, convey the imagination more easily
        from one link to another, and make the whole seem like the continuance
        of one object? In this particular, then, the memory not only discovers
        the identity, but also contributes to its production, by producing the
        relation of resemblance among the perceptions. The case is the same
        whether we consider ourselves or others.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">19. As to <i>causation</i>; we may
        observe, that the true idea of the human mind, is to consider it as a
        system of different perceptions or different existences, which are
        link'd together by the relation of cause and effect, and mutually
        produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other. Our impressions give
        rise to their correspondent ideas; and these ideas in their turn produce
        other impressions. One thought chaces another, and draws after it a
        third, by which it is expell'd in its turn. In this respect, I cannot
        compare the soul more properly to any thing than to a republic or
        commonwealth, in which the several members are united by the reciprocal
        ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other persons,
        who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts.
        And as the same individual republic may not only change its members, but
        also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person may vary
        his character and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas,
        without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his several
        parts are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this view
        our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with
        regard to the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions
        influence each other, and by giving us a present concern for our past or
        future pains or pleasures.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">20. As a memory alone acquaints us
        with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis
        to be considered, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal
        identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of
        causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which
        constitute our self or person. But having once acquir'd this notion of
        causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes, and
        consequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory, and can
        comprehend times, and circumstances, and actions, which we have entirely
        forgot, but suppose in general to have existed. For how few of our past
        actions are there, of which we have any memory? Who can tell me, for
        instance, what were his thoughts and actions on the 1st of <i>January</i>
        1715, the 11th of <i>March</i> 1719, and the 3rd of <i>August</i> 1733?
        Or will he affirm, because he has entirely forgot the incidents of these
        days, that the present self is not the same person with the self of that
        time; and by that means overturn all the most established notions of
        personal identity? In this view, therefore, memory does not so much <i>produce</i>
        as <i>discover</i> personal identity, by shewing us the relation of
        cause and effect among our different perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on
        those, who affirm that memory produces entirely our personal identity,
        to give a reason why we can thus extend our identity beyond our memory.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">21. The whole of this doctrine leads
        us to a conclusion, which is of great importance in the present affair, <i>viz.</i>
        that all the nice and subtile questions concerning personal identity can
        never possibly be decided, and are to be regarded rather as grammatical
        than as philosophical difficulties. Identity depends on the relations of
        ideas; and these relations produce identity, by means of that easy
        transition they occasion. But as the relations, and the easiness of the
        transition may diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just standard,
        by which we can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they
        acquire or lose a title to the name of identity. All the disputes
        concerning the identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except
        so far as the relation of parts gives rise to some fiction or imaginary
        principle of union, as we have already observed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">22. What I have said concerning the
        first origin and uncertainty of our notion of identity, as apply'd to
        the human mind, may be extended with little or no variation to that of <i>simplicity</i>.
        An object, whose different co-existent parts are bound together by a
        close relation, operates upon the imagination after much the same manner
        as one perfectly simple and indivisible and requires not a much greater
        stretch of thought in order to its conception. From this similarity of
        operation we attribute a simplicity to it, and feign a principle of
        union as the support of this simplicity, and the center of all the
        different parts and qualities of the object.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Thus we have finish'd our examination
        of the several systems of philosophy, both of the intellectual and
        natural world; and in our miscellaneous way of reasoning have been led
        into several topics; which will either illustrate and confirm some
        preceding part of this discourse, or prepare the way for our following
        opinions. 'Tis now time to return to a more close examination of our
        subject, and to proceed in the accurate anatomy of human nature, having
        fully explain'd the nature of our judgment and understandings.</font></p>
