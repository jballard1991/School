My most beloved piece hardware is the Graphical Processing Unit, or GPU. Not so long ago, video cards were really very simple devices. In fact, the first computer many people have ever used was known as a "dumb terminal", or basically just a character display device connected by serial cable to a huge computer. Eventually monitors and the cards that drive them became separate, but the humble video card was still a relatively simple device. As the video game industry began to recover from the atari crash of the 80s, new games like Doom and Quake prompted the companies 3dFX and nVidia to compete to create the most powerful graphics devices possible. The result of this hard work and innovation was incredible. As Moore's law began to stop the ridiculous advancements of the 90s in transistors, the clever work around to this problem was to begin to push for the development of multiple core CPUs. While a typical CPU could have anywhere from 4 to 16 cores on a workstation, even modest graphics cards have hundreds or thousands of cores within them. Due to the non general nature of the problems that GPUs tackle, they are able to innovate extremely clever ways of becoming more highly parallel and efficient.

The result is absolutely staggering. We have things like 'Augmented Reality' on cell phones, the Occulus Rift VR headset, Microsoft's new table based VR, and games which push the limits of how good simulated worlds can look. Thats just the originally intended application of the technology. Developers have taken the unique capabilities of GPUs and created a currency with them -- BitCoin. Malicious evil doers use GPUs to crack password hashes that would otherwise take years in hours or minutes. By donating GPU time to research scientists you can literally help cure cancer. How much cooler can a piece or hardware get than that?
