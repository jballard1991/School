-> the rise of greek civilization <-

Modern western civilization begins with the greeks. The greeks are the foundation of modern logical reasoning and political culture. Wars follow the greek people, with the trojan war setting the context for both the oddesey and the illiad. The people were petty and fought for material wealth, but upheld ideas of virtuous hero figures, and were highly competitive. The greek people took pride in their naked bodies as a way of elavating themselves closer to the gods. They were a very headstrong people and viewed themselves as the best of all people. The greeks consider their heros not just to be the strongest, but also the cleverest. Gods were anatomically human and had human passion, and therefore also human flaws. The greeks did not worship men as masters, and saw themselves as independant. The Sea was a great greek ally in that it allowed mobility and trade between Polis.
