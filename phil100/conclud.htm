                authorship which was carried out in the mode of &quot;indirect 
                communication&quot; (as opposed to the direct, non-pseudonymous 
                authorship of his religious works). The initial title in outlines 
                was &quot;Logical Issues&quot;, but Kierkegaard eventually changed 
                this neutral heading to a more humorous version (see explanation 
                below). In accord with this change the two subtitles now read &quot;A Mimical-Pathetical-Dialectical Compilation, An Existential Contribution&quot;. 
                The work was published under pseudonym (alias) Johannes Climacus

                in this case to <i>Philosophical Fragments</i> (1844). As the 
                addendum exceeds five times its base, it is obvious that Kierkegaard 
                is making fun of his own urge to complement his previous &quot;pamphlet&quot; 
                (also a self-ironizing term) with a &quot;compilation&quot; of 
                prolonged after-thoughts on speculative philosophy.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b>Unscientific:</b> This adjective clearly indicates that for 
                Kierkegaard existing is not a science or a speculative reflection 
                upon the vicissitudes of human life. Consequently, it is not something 
                that could be thought, obtained from others or transmitted to 
                others. It is something very simple and individual. As there are 
                no partnerships in faith, by the same token there are no schoolmasters 
                in the art of existing. No philosophical system or speculative 
                construction could replace first-hand experience and passion. 
                &quot;In relation to existing there is for all existing persons 
                one schoolmaster - existence itself.&quot; (<i>Journals</i>, iii 
                2809, 2823) <br>
                <b><font size="2">Note:</font></b><font size="2"> This statement 
                is directed against Hegel and abstract philosophizing in general, 
                but should not be understood as a repudiation of thinking and 
                reflection <i>tout court</i>. Kierkegaard is a thinker himself, 
                and misology was the last thing he would subscribe himself to. 
                As we shall see below, he only wanted to distinguish between essential 
                knowledge pertaining to existence and accidental knowledge pertaining 
                just to our learning and social roles. </font></p>
              <p><br>
                <b>Concluding: </b>With this adjective Kierkegaard announces the 
                end of his activity as a literary author. This is the reason why 
                he signed the book with the pseudonym Climacos (<i>The Ladder</i>) 
                indicating that he has reached the final point in his literary 
                career. He planned to continue writing but only under his real 
                name and in the form of criticism or religious authorship. However 
                he soon found himself enmeshed in several polemics which prevented 
                him from terminating his literary activity and so the <i>Postscript</i> 
                became rather the turning point between his aesthetic and religious 
                oeuvre then the final end of indirect authorship. </p>

            <td width="76%" bgcolor="#FFCC99"> <font size="2">Kierkegaard uses 
              the expression "mimical" to suggest that the work appropriately 
              imitates (&quot;mimes&quot;) the emotions and thoughts discussed 
              by the author. As H. and E. Hong point out, it may also refer to 
              a gathering of all the earlier "mimed" (pseudonymous) works as the background 
              material for this "concluding" work. The &quot;pathetical&quot; 
              means simply "pathos-filled" and refers to Kierkegaard's poetical 
              rendering of Climacus. The &quot;dialectical&quot; denotes Kierkegaard 
              himself in the capacity of a thinker. Thus the author (Climacus) 
              is all at once: an imitator, a poet and a philosopher (the whole 
              formula could be also a reference to various stages in life and 
              respective transitions in thought or existence). </font></td>

              life. On the contrary, its characteristics are feelings of uncertainty,

                Kierkegaard conceives correspondence between thoughts and objects

                of human existence: the notion of identity becomes &quot;a chimera 
                of abstraction&quot; if both thought and being are constantly 
                changing. If the knower is an existing individual, an individual 
                who lives in time, this notion is inapplicable. Fichte's formula 
                &quot;I am I&quot; is such an abstraction, an example of &quot;fantastic 
                realism&quot; that does not speak anything to a &quot;particular 
                individual&quot;. Speculative philosophy leads to abstract formulas

                the one that expresses temporal expectations and current approximations. 
                If the object of self-knowing constantly supersedes itself then 
                no stage in the process of becoming is final and thus no statement 
                could be the final truth about it. Concrete beings can never be 
                adequately and definitely cognized - our ideas about ourselves 
                are always &quot;subject to correction and improvement&quot;.

              <p><b><font size="2">Note 1:</font></b><font size="2"> &quot;Modern 
                philosophy holds passion in contempt.&quot; This does not hold 
                true for many great thinkers, including Hegel, who became renown 
                for his claim that nothing great happens in history without passion. 
                Lessing took passion as the most fundamental characteristic of 
                being human. In the same vein Feuerbach asserted that &quot;only 
                passion is the mark of existence&quot; and &quot;only what is 
                an object of passion really is&quot;. Without acknowledging his 
                debt to this tradition Kierkegaard agrees that passion is the 
                ultimate source of personal integration. Only through passion 
                can a person begin to collect herself and acquire a direction 
                that unites otherwise dissipated life plans and inclinations. 
                The decision to adopt certain life-style is never just an intellectual 
                decision based solely on some objective cognitions. It is always 
                ultimately rooted in what a person cares about and deeply values, 
                i.e. in passions. Only through passion intellectually conceived 
                possibilities could be transformed into actualities. The individual 
                synthetizes the eternal and the temporal by reduplicating timeless 
                ideals and norms in time and concrete existence. In this respect 
                passions are much more important than intellectual insights or 
                ideas. It is possible to imaginatively conceive many possibilities 
                and to be able to think them through without ever humanly existing. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font size="2"><b>Note 2:</b> Passion reveals interest in existence, 
                that is, the care for Self which is the engine of all individual strivings. 
                To have a passion means to care for something or someone, as opposed 
                to the indifference of the objective attitude. If I care about 
                something I do not regard it as valueless. The object of passion 
                is always considered by passion as worthy of the caring passion. 
                Thus we speak about being passionate about something in the sense 
                of being enthusiastic. This usage of the term stresses the active 
                moment of passion which is regarded as the source of free action. 
                Kierkegaard rejects the notion that passion is just an irrational 
                and involuntary emotion that takes control over us from without, 
                as if we are only passive object of its unpredictable and unaccountable 
                force (for instance, &quot;he murdered her in a fit of passion&quot;). 
                He recognizes that passion possesses a moment of passivity, since 
                we cannot induce a passion deliberately. For instance, it is not 
                possible to decide to have a love or religious passion (passions are not intentionally created), but they could be developed and 
                cultivated. In that sense the individual is responsible for them 
                as his own state of mind. The individual also bears a credit for 
                having a creative passion, artistic, teaching, or religious. Possessing 
                a passion is what makes someone better than a person of the same 
                occupation or activity, not physical abilities or the intensity 
                of desire. </font></p>

                &quot;a young boy&quot;. In logic, explicating in the predicate 
                term what is already contained in the subject term (&quot;Bachelors 
                are unmarried males.&quot;). The truth of tautologies is established 
                either through the logical form of the expression (A=A) or through 
                the meanings of the involved concepts. Experience cannot falsify 
                tautologies. </p>
              <p><b>Speculative Philosophy,</b> literally, the philosophy that 
                &quot;mirrors&quot; the existing consequences unto their invisible 
                first causes; therefore it is &quot;theoretical&quot; and abstract; 
                Kierkegaard uses the expression either to denote German Idealism 
                or any philosophy that curtails thinking from its existential 
                ground and so creating &quot;tautologies&quot;, &quot;fantastic

                or &quot;All mothers are women&quot; and &quot;All obese people 
                are fat&quot;). </p>
              <p><b>Reduplication,</b> the term used by Kierkegaard to denote 
                the reality &quot;doubling&quot; of what we think, that is to 
                say, it refers to the realizion or &quot;putting into practice&quot; 
                that &quot;how one thinks one ought to live&quot;. To be able 
                to &quot;be what one says&quot; one needs both the ability of 
                subjective self-reflection and the strenght to carry out the insights 
                into existence. </p>
              <p><b>Mediation, </b>(in German <i>Vermittlung</i>) the term used 
                by Hegel to oppose the view that our knowledge of phenomenal and 
                supernatural reality is direct (F. Jacobi). Hegel was convinced 
                that unrelated existence is not possible and therefore the process 
                of understanding reality consists in establishing links with the 
                pertinent factors and instances of reality (nature, society, 
				language). For Hegel, these connections 
                and mediations already exist; the question is only to become aware 
                of them and thus to overcome the illusion of immediacy through 
                an insight into the mediated immediacy. For Kierkegaard, individual 
                existence could be mediated only through negation of its individuality. 
              </p>
              <p><b>Subjectivity, </b>a whole host of concepts denoting inwardness: 
                Ego, I, Self, consciousness, existence, spirit. For Kierkegaard 
                it is the place of existential truth, which is defining for an 
                individual. The term thus refers to the process by which an individual 
                existentially appropriates what he thinks. </p>

              the individual with the object of passion as in metaphysical strivings

              a counter-demonstration of what they purport to prove - their acts 
              are the most convincing refutation of immortality. Kierkegaard compares 
              them with wedded matrons who have been subjected to many expressions 
              of (erotic) love but never enjoyed love itself (as passion). Socrates 
              is in that respect like a girl who stakes everything on the weak 
              hope that (s)he is beloved (by immortality). </td>

            <td width="76%">Socrates stakes his life on the condition that the 
              soul is immortal, but he does not possess any certainty about it. 
              He puts the question of immortality in a &quot;problematic manner&quot;: 
              <i>If </i>there is an immortality. Thus he is cognitively a doubter 
              or an ignorant. But nobody was more in truth (in paganism) than 
              Socrates while in his ignorance. Ignorance is the adequate expression 
              of the relationship between the eternal truth and the existing individual. 
              The eternal truth which is not paradoxical in itself becomes paradoxical 
              by being related to an existing person. This relation must remain 
              a paradox as long as the individual exists. But in risking his entire 
              life he provides a more effective proof of immortality than anything 
              one can derive from philosophical assertions about the nature of 
              the soul. The certainty of immortality is rooted in subjectivity 
              and the quality of existential appropriation (reduplication). </td>

              is scrupulously rendered, the &quot;what&quot; should follow. That 
              the quality of our existential stature is crucial for the assessment 
              of our veracity attests the principle which places integrity over 
              orthodoxy. In the light of this principle it is easy to understand 
              the saying that what is &quot;in itself true&quot; may become untrue 
              in the mouth of such and such person. This personal moment of truthfulness 
              is an essential part of what Kierkegaard calls the &quot;how&quot; 
              of utterances or the &quot;mode of the relationship&quot;. The &quot;how&quot; 
              refers to the passion of inwardness, i.e. subjectivity (Kierkegaard's 
              &quot;all the passion of infinity&quot; is what we call &quot;inner 
              integrity&quot;). This is why it matters who speaks, almost as much

              if separated from our subjectivity. Living truthfully is man's primary
